Who are they to be telling we the American ppl who and who not to vote for. @realDonaldTrump will win! https://t.co/ENXRwcoYrt
I definitely don't want to think about that but if the Saudis are calling the shots then we have a Yuge problem  https://t.co/ENXRwcoYrt
I'm thinking it's happening now. Ryan not supporting @realDonaldTrump they may have a vested interest in DJT losing https://t.co/ENXRwcoYrt
And really like we the people are going to ever listen to he Saudis. Never.  https://t.co/HrTBppCaVS
Which may mean they have influence over our politicians. Which is bad for we the people.  https://t.co/HrTBppCaVS
Yes! Agree! But the Saudis are trying to keep him out and asking for Americans not to vote for him.  https://t.co/HrTBppCaVS
I Agee he wouldn't do that.I'm team trump.I'm talking abt our political officials now.They r pushing 2 keep him out  https://t.co/j8ihgX7itj
That's called propaganda!  They compare @realDonaldTrump 2 a horrible dictator but they need 2look in a mirror 1st  https://t.co/oAnoxTjUva
W/ his money He may have more Influence on our political officials. Big problem! @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/Bfv2UOAQYG
