Amazing!"
@periledgerald 😂
@JOEMAMA526 Trump won almost as many votes as Hillary in FL running against 3 others.

"@marklindesr I'm not saying I totally agree with him, but I it makes sense how he came to his point."
@_HankRearden What are you looking at? haha
@3cats2kidslater Trump's point was that the issue should have been left alone instead of making a scandal out of it. @mitchellvii
@marklindesr There was very few problems before they made it a scandal.
@marklindesr Trump's answer wasn't as bad as I thought. His point was that making an anti-LBGT law causes unneeded controversy.
