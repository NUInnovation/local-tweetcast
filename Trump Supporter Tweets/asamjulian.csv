@MkMadonnakin That’s very wise.
"In Florida,

Trump won 1,077,221 votes against 3 others (1,040,864 votes)
Hillary won 1,097,400 votes against 1 (566,603 votes)

Amazing!"
@periledgerald 😂
@JOEMAMA526 Trump won almost as many votes as Hillary in FL running against 3 others.
Cruz getting steam-rolled in all the NE states then claiming he’s the only one to beat Hillary is just classic Lyin’ Ted Cruz. 🙄😂
@LDJT2016 Much less than 6%. I think less than 1%.
"@ps3592 lol, I pity the fool who takes Karl Rove seriously. @mitchellvii"
@atlantatweeps You’re probly right.
"Anyone that desires to become the opposite sex should be admitted to a mental institution immediately, not have laws made for them."
@Oldfolksmatter Yes sir. All women going out alone should be packing. :)
"If a dude wants to go into a bathroom to rape a woman, he is going to do so regardless of any laws in place. Similar to gun-free zones."
"@atlantatweeps Lol, Cruz runs with anything. He says Trump was part of the mob and a million other things."
@atlantatweeps Trump said he knew he was going to be asked that question. He wasn't unprepared...
@snowberry Not at all. It makes you a lover of justice. @_HankRearden
@LDJT2016 Exactly. That was Trump's entire point.
@atlantatweeps Did you actually listen to the interview? @SnafuWorld @bocavista2016 @mitchellvii @ahernandez85a
@RBMills32 Sometimes they are not that distinguishable. Don't think its quite that easy.

"While I disagree on principle with the whole transgender movement, how does an anti-trans bathroom law actually get enforced?"
@mitchellvii I wonder how the anti-trans law gets enforced. Anyone wanna be hired for that job? 😄
.@kincannon_show Good question.
@marklindesr Here is the whole quote in context. Not exactly how you were making it out to be. https://t.co/WPWbQPdL2B
"@mitchellvii Yeah, definitely. @3cats2kidslater"
"@marklindesr I'm not saying I totally agree with him, but I it makes sense how he came to his point."
@_HankRearden What are you looking at? haha
@3cats2kidslater Trump's point was that the issue should have been left alone instead of making a scandal out of it. @mitchellvii
@marklindesr There was very few problems before they made it a scandal.
@marklindesr Trump's answer wasn't as bad as I thought. His point was that making an anti-LBGT law causes unneeded controversy.
The consistency of a #NeverTrump dumbass. https://t.co/EZoH2M5pkS

"Hey Club for Growth, I have some college debt I need to pay off. Please send me your $1 million instead of wasting it on anti-Trump ads."
@mitchellvii In this election especially.
Club for Growth is going to spend $1 million in anti-Trump ads in Indiana because they worked so well everywhere else. What a waste of $$.
