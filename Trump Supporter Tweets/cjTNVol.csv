@UT_BOGUSS I don't like the delegate system nor the electoral college. Popular vote should decide
@UT_BOGUSS He could get the votes just not the super delegates
"@UT_BOGUSS I voted for HRC in the Primary in '08, but after Benghazi I won't vote for her"
"@NickKristof @jaketapper I buy books from minorities. Being a DJT supporter, that must shock you"
@UT_BOGUSS I'm not taking the bait. Are you a HRC supporter?

@brithume @SpeakerRyan Agenda gives POTUS everything he wants. That should not be true blue.
I do not support @SpeakerRyan agenda

@GovGaryJohnson You do not need to run. You are electing HRC! You do not represent me! #WomenForTrump #AmericaFirstüá∫üá∏
Why do you continue to bash DJT? BOYCOTT STATIONS THAT BASH DJT! @FoxNews @CNN @ABC @MSNBC
I feel better knowing that you are #NeverHillary @stephenfhayes Have a nice day
@dilemmv @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Two liars &amp; frauds
@1lolamarina @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump What has he lied about?
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump DJT did not lie. You must have him confused with HRC. She lies about everything especially email &amp; Benghazi
"@Waycooljr62 @SenFrankNiceley Yes, every time I seen Cruz, I changed the channel, so did other DJT supporters"
@Waycooljr62 @SenFrankNiceley FoxNews covered Cruz bc I quit watching them. Cruz wouldn't do interviews he was invited to do
@vtul7321 Priceless
"Why would you rather see HRC win than DJT? @MittRomney @BillKristol @JoeNBC Please reconsider. Why? 2A, SCOTUS nominees!"
@Waycooljr62 @SenFrankNiceley Not so much on FoxNews that's why they got boycotted. Their ratings dropped. CNN beat FoxNews
"@Waycooljr62 @SenFrankNiceley CNN, FoxNews, MSNBC"
"@SenFrankNiceley @Waycooljr62 I don't listen to talk radio &amp; I don't watch The Apprentice, but I do support DJT"
@KnoxSportsGuy @KLSouth @WSJ He has business experience which is badly needed. GOPe have a good o boy club that rewards corruption
"@KnoxSportsGuy @KLSouth @WSJ DJT is an outsider. That's why I would not vote for Cruz&gt;insider, pathological liar, career politician"
"@KnoxSportsGuy @KLSouth @WSJ I'm not for a 3rd party running, gives it to HRC. I believe in DJT. Be cynical if you want to"

@ABC @ScandalABC Country people are not filthy inbred &amp; ignorant. You are guilty of progressive racism. Don't watch your show. Never will
@LadyVeteran23 @MichaelRayAdam2 That makes me proud!

Illegals should be deported. There is nothing racist about it. They broke the immigration law. We don't need Muslim rapefugees! @SenWarren
Stop calling them Americans! They are illegals bc they BROKE THE IMMIGRATION LAW! They should be deported @HillaryClinton
