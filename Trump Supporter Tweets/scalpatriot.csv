@missynorris411 even they are embarrassed for us
@roblefeber @JaredWyand California is a prime example.
"Cruz keeps leaning in different people as a crutch to try to keep going. Cmon Donald, take him (and us American people) out of his misery"
"@ISIS_B_Gone @hale4jesus @RealJohnnyZ @TWA2Garp @tomesimpson @ChuckNellis Yep, two cartoon characters"
BOOOOM https://t.co/Z3CbXFTi1P
@ABPolitical I couldn't do it. He does it day after day. I'm admire his resolve for sure
We need a really strong recovery and securing our border to withstand the burden of the millenial generation on America in the coming years
"If Obama gets a fence to make his house safe from terrorists, we do too. Build that wall. Now!"
@immigrant4trump wetbacks have been making a good living in Southern California for decades. We have a micro economy here.
The one good thing about this current news cycle is we don't hear about Obama. But it makes me a little nervous. He never just does nothing
Aww Ted. You mad? https://t.co/zrKAfvdaO7
Ted Cruz is so transparent how he accused trump in attacking Hillery trying to make the woman issue work for him. Boehner's right about Cruz
This is what we get with democratic presidents https://t.co/D84VEBoIFH
It's pathetic that Carly is getting a rise out of Twitter more than Cruz. She bombed and he is doing worse
Cruz knows he's dead and would drop out but he has nothing else to do. Going around bullshitting IS his only skill https://t.co/FvJgy0tK4O
THIS is America  https://t.co/sY7DOhuGS2
@PatriotJames7 Congrats Carly on becoming the first transgender fantasy vp.
I support Donald Trump because he is willing and able to run as the voice of America. He is us with money. https://t.co/Wd6RmXcoa2
@CityGirl_SD @mitchellvii @LindaSuhler no way
@Jorge_Miyar @jCar89000 I revel in the fact that you will be suffering for the next 8+ years as the walls squeeze in on you America-haters
BWAHAHAHA https://t.co/ocLJqJU1Np
@zesty_trump Donald trump tackled your ugly face and you're out of the game so shut the hell up
At the start of the campaign the senators sounded informed but as time goes on Trump sounds more informed. Their points were from briefings
@sunnykcollins Karl Rove depends on staying in the good graces of the Bush family like a trust fund baby
@ImJuliCaldwell I don't think so. They're both severely unlikeable beasts
THIS is the face of a patriotic and prosperous America https://t.co/W2YBatzj7G
America: THIS is not who we are https://t.co/C6uCKbQA8J
America: THIS is not who we are https://t.co/eYwOu95MDM
Donald Trump is one good man risking it all with his own money surrounded by fools and corrupt politicians. https://t.co/e5cCSWTJIR
Ted Cruz picking Carly Fiorini as his fantasy running mate is a predictable move by a fantasy  do-nothing senator. All show. No results.
Curly is like a bad stomach flu that keeps coming back. Every time I see her fucking face I puke a little in my mouth. Enough already!
Mr Trump: please close the border and build the wall. Southern California used to be a great place to live and can be again with your help.
@JaredWyand Now we need to see pics of a TSA feeling up a Muslim woman in her hate sheet
@JaredWyand How dare a filthy Muslim touch a nun.
@JohnKStahlUSA @HarrellRyan1 It would be a major step toward making America great again.
Cruz needs to accept defeat and bow out with grace. It's so un-presidential to drown and make a spectacle of himself. We all see him sucking
Donald Trump is leading the charge to make America great again. He is inspiring people to get involved. That's leadership.
@97Musick Carly who? You must mean that other bad judgement call from a drowning candidate who is getting Trumped
DrowningTed https://t.co/jptAmzy9tt
Teds drowning https://t.co/QX5ZhXHVYq
Carly is irrelevant just like Kasich. Ted is going down and is trying to grab at ANY life preserver he can. https://t.co/nRKKdXt9es
Ted Cruz is the failed candidate that stands in Trump's way-Carly is just a distraction https://t.co/UgHjEoPjb1
"Ted Cruz teamed up with a failed candidate (Kasich) and now has teamed up with another failed candidate (Carly). Dude, you've already lost"
@Crippled1963 @Rubberblon @bclew70 @magnifier661 @rtoberl @DefendingtheUSA @tedcruz That's the best picture of Carly I've seen yet
Have they have sex yet? https://t.co/fzz7g7E36X
@LeahR77 Mexican punks like that drop with one good punch in the nose
BWAHAHAHA! The closest either will ever get to the White House is in their fantasy  https://t.co/snfh7cpIhd
@immigrant4trump Trump is slumming to t coming to California. He needs to wait until after he's closed the border and built the wall.
Creepy Cruz and Creepy Carly.  https://t.co/SNK0STlfoK
The more people listen to what Cruz has to say the less they trust him.
Yeah. I guess they were uh not evangelicals? BWAHAHAHA https://t.co/nPz0QxE8Oa
Hey Ted Cruz and your hard headed supporters: if you had strong wins like Trump you'd be calling for Kasich to drop out. Hypocrite
@AnnCoulter @JohnQPu43054918 The others can't prepare written responses fast enough. Trump speaks unscripted
"Man, Hillary looks seriously old..."
Hillary is white and yet white people don't like her. She's big with blacks. Something is not right about that.
Hey Ted Cruz: you've been spinning you shitty results so hard you need to sit down and get real with yourself. You're done. Finito.
Really? After today you probably regret that. My guy swept 5!! Woo hoo  https://t.co/SnOBaRDwyG
There's a huge difference between Trump and Hillary. Hillary always sounds like she's delivering speeches someone else wrote for her.
@AndrewsHarley And if the t went to a convention neither would win. The GOPe would not support any of the three
@ABC @JimmyForTrump Same ole talking points out of his piehole
@Stealth_Patriot @tedcruz @ToddHagopian @LoriKemp @realDonaldTrump And. Can't stand Bernie
@Stealth_Patriot @tedcruz @ToddHagopian @LoriKemp @realDonaldTrump Never going t happen. I'll vote for Bernie before I'll vote for a GOPe
@captainhook1961 @instapundit @nypost They believe that it's a concealed form of racism. That's how twisted and demented they are
Scum of a feather flock together https://t.co/gvRtA56bLB
I'm glad to see Cruz and Kasich team up.  It means when they go down there's a clear winner and no more stupid republican skirmishes
"Ted Cruz was, is and will always be a douche"
@AmberForAmerica @DMashak @_CFJ_ You sure those are dreamers? Those look like Rubio's family. Bwahahaha
https://t.co/btO4VSae3N
@johannesansgaar @JaredWyand Yeah right! So weak...
We've got a whole lot of media spokeholes making a lot of noise trying to confuse we the people. Just report the news assholes. We got this
https://t.co/cVfBqEMd0H
@maxger31 @Ataya42495443 @realDonaldTrump And like trump I am concerned with what is best for America not the political parties
@maxger31 @Ataya42495443 @realDonaldTrump I've believed that since he announced running. He is the ONLY one who can get the crossover voters
@ResoluteBelle I agree. I'm republican just to get Trump elected at this point
@maxger31 @Ataya42495443 To defeat the democratic nominee and build the wall will be a major step toward turning the titanic around
@maxger31 @Ataya42495443 The democratic machine is so powerful that it will be a major victory to defeat them.
@Stuntin420 If you pulled your head out of Obama's ass you'd see the truth more clearly
@Stuntin420 Yeah right.
@rsultzba @bs21868 @BuddyAdams3 Absokutely right Ray
@scalpatriot Sounds better when Samuel L Jackson says it
The path of the righteous man (Trump) is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish (GOPe) and the tyranny of evil men (Cruz &amp; John
"@terrykimk93 @teed_chris He's a nobody, trying to be a somebody, who will pretend to be anybody"
I'll know when we have truly made America great again...when we can fearlessly put a republican bumper sticker on our car in California
@BillKS1 @realDonaldTrump Glad to know someone in Seattle has common sense. Amen
@Darren32895836 @BillGallagher19 I can't even turn up the volume. Can't stand this MSM fu khead
@politico @itunes65 The sign of true desperation
Me too https://t.co/G9ODHoOvP5
They both know that with Rubio supporting Trump and the gop softening to him they're DONE https://t.co/uztSahqVV3
@DonaldTrumpCA @FrancesFrancine @sf4trump Anaheim likes it's illegal alien culture
Obama will help make America great again when he LEAVES office. The economy will explode building the military back up to safe levels.
@ToddHagopian @LoriKemp @Stealth_Patriot @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz Good riddance. My support of Trump has NEVER faltered. Cruz is a slimebag
https://t.co/gwvp6ZGrTR via @youtube
@OlderWiseOne @FoxNews @JohnKasich @HillaryClinton it would be good for news ratings but horrible for America's future
@FrancesFrancine @DonaldTrumpCA @sf4trump The enemy like Gloria Molina

@Hubert1Jr One applied to enter and become an American. They had to PLEDGE allegiance and become one of us. The other stayed Mexican
@linda_blakeway Yep
@tladd58 We all would love a perfect president and a perfect country's but our ideas of what is perfect all differ.
@SputnikInt @TeamTrumpRussia Any self respecting female would rather die than have sex with these Islamic cavemen psychos
If it's acceptable for mayor of West Los Angeles to tell a candidate he's unwelcome it's equally acceptable to tell trannies they are too
@EWErickson @katiepack @resurgent a) Yes and b) No
@TheRickWilson @katiepack @nationaljournal Rick Wilson is a hit and run bottom feeder.
@tonynausetbeac1 All or nothing thinking will guarantee 8 more insane years under a democrat. The far right doesn't have the numbers to win
Wah wah wah wahhhhh https://t.co/VKC1Be8W7J
@Kotcha301 @Contumedia He knows. Some of us don't. That's the challenge.
No candidate could meet the expectations of the far right. And no far right candidate would appeal to enough voters to defeat Hillary.
Isis member shares plan on how to infiltrate US through Mexico. https://t.co/HyhJrRAxPm
@MomsforMorals @surfermom77 @Chris11962 @maeganvaz Yeah same with Jeb Bush Carly Fiorina and others who support Ted Cruz
@NumbersMuncher @PatriotJames7 That's so true and well stated
All the candidates did their best to swim to the lead. But now the thing we can all agree on is NoHillaryNoWayEver!
@Mercedes_Tingle OK fine how about the first one he ever brought up illegal immigration. He has not caved in on building the wall. THERE!
Maryland &amp; Michigan allow Muslim students to pray during school hours but not Christians. It's time to bring back the pledge of allegiance
@immigrant4trump @MarcoGutierrez We love all people who seek to become Americans because they seek our identity-not just our prosperity.
@scalpatriot He has shown us repeatedly that insecure people can't challenge our values if we believe in them unapologetically.
I really admire Donald Trump. No one else in American society has so successfully withstood the pressure to bow to so many insecure people
Amen. I support you because you consider yourself an American above all else.  Go brother  https://t.co/yQy5UGUh4Q
Just another way of saying walking on eggshells to not hurt the feelings of insecure people https://t.co/6KI3ZmfE3P
@tdwightusa More like those who came just after WWII. Descendants of WWII are the good guys. They love America.
@Chris11962 @surfermom77 @maeganvaz That must infuriate Cruz. No one likes Cruz.
@tdwightusa Actually the problem you're seeing is the result of poor parenting by the 60's generation.
Hey Britain. Ignore him. We do.  https://t.co/Cp37cfUJ8F
@tdwightusa This is the codependent generation.
Conservative is as conservative does. Trump is more conservative with how he manages money  https://t.co/c84NZKWVeH
Political correctness is just another way of describing a culture in which we walk on eggshells to avoid offending people who are insecure
