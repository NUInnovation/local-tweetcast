@katscags62  it's equal or worse in California.
@BarbaraJensen1 @Callisto1947 @katscags62 @CA4TRUMP Be prepared for the far left labor unions and teacher unions to come out in force here
We need a strong comeback after eight years of a symbolic and worthless Obama presidency and Trump is the one.  https://t.co/QA7RUrmkhF
@kathleenbieleck @SquidsLighters That's what mothers used to tell their daughters before they were married. Society was a lot better off too
@rsultzba @DrMartyFox @col_nj @walidshoebat Of course it is and it's also common sense. Can't solve the problem unless you stop and assess.
@SquidsLighters We cannot legislate based on people's psychology. But we CAN legislate based on their biology.
@clmazin @003a04f8c2054b7 The only thing Ted can do at this point is TRY to prevent America from overhauling its corrupt Republican Party.
It's so simple. Keep the penises away from the vaginas.  https://t.co/6XrrjbpLE8
@lobes4business and delivering talking points from the Senate floor doesn't make one an expert either
@ronaldmanning6 because if they deny him the domination at 1237 there will be a mass exodus of the party like never seen before
@ronaldmanning6 I hope he gets 1237. They will deny him the nomination and it will inspire Republicans to support him as an independent
@scalpatriot  if he doesn't get 1237 that will be the last we hear of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.
@scalpatriot  They don't care if he gets 1237. If he doesn't they avoid blame of being biased against us voters.
"If the RNC is going to decide who the Republican nominee is, why bother having an election at all? Just hoping Trump won't get 1237?"
@jaysandheat13 @eagle_president is a symbol of of America stupidity to the rest of the world now
@jaysandheat13 @eagle_president he was a symbolic president in term 1 and special interests and Soros secured him term 2
@jaysandheat13 @eagle_president Because Obama is a symbolic president only. His agenda doesn't represent the values of America
Donald Trump is a modern day Paul Revere. Anyone else would never withstand the dirty influence of political donors who shape Washington
If we elect anyone other than Trump we are allowing political bribery and blackmailing to persist as a way of life in Washington.
Only someone who is already wealthy has the will to end political bribery in Washington. That is why Washington is terrified of Trump
Senators are the last people who are going to support ending political bribery because their lifestyles depend on that money.
Our senators are supposed to be like postal workers. They're supposed to deliver the people's voice to Washington. But they have been bribed
Basically our government has turned their low-paid representative jobs into prestigious careers by accepting special interest bribe money
We cast our vote but politicians are paid off and bribed to influence their decision making. That is not America.
It will take electing someone like Trump to free our country of the overwhelming influence of special interest money in policymaking.
That is such a sad statement about America in 2015. Up to us to break the ownership of donors on elected officials https://t.co/6tBuqa7rQm
https://t.co/FRpR1w3AL2
@LesgartCPA @phil200269 @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Qwll said. That's why he's called #BigheadTed
@MickBlair54 @politico And anyone who disagrees with it will be labeled a racist. Yeah we are really free at last.
It IS over like Mark Levin's lame career https://t.co/98a3hNOlNS
Hey GOPe: you don't get to change the rules of the game midstream. That's unethical.
@Republikim1 @Patrioticgirl86 I beat you to it. I don't debate zombies
Car Cameron is like a giddy little girl who loves to stir shit up. Keep polishing the blue hair boys shoes Carl.
Cruz concedes there's no path for him to get 1237. Now give up BigHeadTed. The GOPe will NEVER nominate your lying ass sucker
@JeanieWilliams @davidpwil @LegendaryTrump That's why I call him #BigHeadTed
"@puppymnkey @missbelle4ever @MoffittJill Seriously, spend your time attacking Bernie. If he can give Hillary a challenge she'll get killed"
@puppymnkey @missbelle4ever @MoffittJill Hillarys whole party is made up of old washed up angry gals like you whose ballroom days are over
Cruz is saying trump got 2x delegates in NY w 1/2 votes. Fact Trump NY 523k votes(ish) 92 delegates. Cruz TX 1.2m votes(ish) 104 delegates
@fpatterson1050 @realDonaldTrump That's exactly what Hillary is doing and her supporters are like farts: loud and obnoxious but meaningless
"Even 8 year know Hillary is THE most unlikeable and untrustworthy candidate running. My God lady, is this your best? https://t.co/V99CV1iHhc"
@puppymnkey @missbelle4ever @MoffittJill Ma'am your comments are so misguided that I'm convinced you were born on another planet.
@michaelbeatty3 #BigHeadTed
#BigHeadTed's career as a presidential candidate is over folks. He can't win now and would never win in a contested  https://t.co/ZCFv66lGSP
Ted Cruz is in full spoiler mode. He can't win so all he can do is try to wreck the field for his competition https://t.co/qjn6gm4179
Trump says he will make America great again. Cruz says we will have a contested election. My money is on Trump.  https://t.co/NQD4KQSxsy
@rcanales @CALA_1111 @gatewaypundit You're damned right! Don't let up folks. He sure as hell wouldn't
@focambolesco @Patrioticgirl86 Fultard Luz'ers
I'd rather have Trump occasionally make off color remarks to get the media's attention than support Cruz who has issues telling the truth
@mysteriousfact @Charles07527697 bad advice. Zig zag just makes the distance between it and you shorter. Run like hell straight
@FiveRights She's just doing what she was taught by Al Sharpton and Jesse Jockstrap
@Chloe2229 As he says appropriately if he doesn't win it's all a big waste of time and money for him.
Yep that's what the Cruz camp is doing today  https://t.co/PDs5f4gavL
@Patrioticgirl86 I'll respect you when you and other never trump luz'ers accept its over
@TeeEyeM @Patrioticgirl86 Wow.  You came up with that yourself? Nice job NeverTed
You go girl Hillary! Stick it to the American people. They deserve to be screwed over for another 8 years right?  https://t.co/DrWuM1cqtS
If Trump didn't have the financial means to run for president America would be totally screwed
Trumps been remarkably presidential considering he's running on his own dime. Pay to run your own campaign you get to say what you believe.
@bftravers522 @lyz_estrada @DonaldjBismarck Trump owns her peace of mind already and he hasn't even addressed her. It's beautiful
@rbd738_nancy Seether in your hatred it's satisfying to see your resentment suck the life out of you
@rbd738_nancy Trump has entertained the idiots enough it's time for him to quit this race to bed and make America America again
@rbd738_nancy The only time Ted Cruz gets any media attention is when Trump stands next to him. Why would he help Lyin Ted
@rbd738_nancy why should he debate with somebody who only gets 12% of the vote in New York and who is a filthy scum lying politician
@vannsmole but I said months ago California is a psycho Street and we're going to need help to make America great again on the West Coast
@vannsmole she doesn't get to decide who comes and goes in her city it's not her friggin city
@vannsmole and it's not hers Siri she is just holding out elected position she's not the queen of the area we taxpayers the city
How dare her she is elected official https://t.co/858H3pH7qb
It's ok to cry. I understand how disappointing it is to discover he isn't the man he claimed to be https://t.co/6qt9d7IE9t
I would say Donald Trump was for more presidential than Hillary in her long tirade last night. Trump is a uniter.  https://t.co/irBToCbdQJ
"Speaking of acting presidential, Donald Trump was gracious and didn't ramble on pontificating for an hour like Ted Cruz does when he wins"
The common ground we have is we both believe Washington is corrupt and America needs to come first.  https://t.co/Omg6ak2MoJ
If you're angry at Paul Ryan and his agenda you're really angry at the Washington establishment because they chose him for that position.
@MilitaryRosary @nyuhearmenow @HillaryClinton A $600 haircut on Hillary Clinton is just like putting lipstick on a pig
Paul Ryan was chosen by the GOPe. They chose him and he's making the decisions they want. Ryan illustrates the kind of values the GOPe has.
"@ThePeoplesBacon @ThePatriot143 If you actually listen to him, Trump hasn't mocked anybody who didn't deserve it. Ted is a liar."
What people don't get is Ted Cruz is an attorney and he thrives on being in adversarial positions with everyone. Normal people seek harmony
Didn't Trey Gowdy support Cruz? Now he's withdrawing and distancing himself entirely   https://t.co/1Uf8O0KybF
Washington gave up on America but Trump didn't.  As Americans see the possibility of making America great again they are waking up
@scalpatriot I remember a year ago when this started people said he would be great but he's not really serious about running. He's proving
The votes are going to roll in for Trump as America sees his path to the White House. No one thought there was hope for America until him
@Dlw20161950 @perry1949 Move forward to Canada suckers
The Cruz people don't seem to accept is that America truly wants Trump but didn't know if he would get the votes. He's proving he will
@wpjenna @LaurelCatherine @pbump Anything is possible to throw this election if you use enough bush family money to buy political influence
"To paraphrase a line from the movie Barfly, ""I don't hate Cruz. I just like better when he's not around."""
"Donald Trump is the ""blue-collar billionaire""."
@kvictoria1103 BWAHAHAHAHA!!!
Haha! We won 90+ delegates and you won NONE. Not one! Bwahahaha!!!!
Go ahead Cruz spend millions of dollars trying to defeat Trump. You're just wasting the Bush family's money
All this oversensitivity when Trump wins is an indication of how fragile and desperate liberal people are.
Check out Fox. After each of these primaries they always have a trump hater in the panel and not a trump supporter. They're so biased!
"When these folks are targeted, don't f'ing complain about how they're being victimized. People like this WILL pay https://t.co/pnTVtyu43b"
@jtaylor_111 I have my own ideas but I suspect you have a theory
Cmon Trump stop playing with your food. Eat the son of a bitch Cruz so we ca get to work on America
Cruz campaign actually believes that if this race went to a contested election the GOP would get behind Cruz. No way sucka's.
Fox would love this to go to a contested election because it's good for their viewership.
The majority of the Republican Party can't stand Ted Cruz and will NEVER consolidate behind him
Trump stomped on Cruz's head and Fox is giving Cruz a voice to try to undermine him. Proves Fox actually for the democraps
@scalpatriot seriously what's the point of giving them legal status as long as more can just wander into our country and work for cash?
Where is all the men in that Hillary audience? Oh I know they're at home breast-feeding the children
The one good thing about sharia law is that Hillary Clinton would have to shut the hell up
I wonder how much she paid that so-called diversity audience that is like a prop behind her. Nine out of 10 female more than half are black
Vote for Hillary because George Soros isn't running!
Hey Hillary nice job making shit up about trumps positions
Hey Hillary what is the point of passing comprehensive immigration reform as long as people can trespass into our country? Why bother???
Hillary's speech was no doubt written by some guy who duct tapes his manhood between his cheeks and wears makeup.
"Hey Hillary, we aren't supposed to deport people who are trespassers to our country?  You are the problem with America"
Hillary Clinton is the neighbor lady who yells to stay off her lawn and you end up doing a burn out on it the first opportunity
Hey Ted! BOOOOM you serial adultering piece of trash https://t.co/wXkinaQtdv
What the media are not anticipating is that there is a sizable amount of Bernie supporters who would support trump before Hillary
@MissMeliss078 @LindaSuhler California has a lot of small business people who've taken a beating with Mexican trespassers and outsourcing
@MissMeliss078 @LindaSuhler Cruz is the one who doesn't fit the personality and the profile of a conservative Californian
@MissMeliss078 @LindaSuhler California is a mixture of government workers union members left wing Progressives and rugged individuals.
It's a lot more fun to be on the side that's winning. I've been riding the Trump train since he made his announcement. Rock on!
If you think Trump is killing it in New York he will do the same thing in California.
"When FukCruz won irrelevant Wisconsin, media was so happy it was nauseating. Trump is killing it in NY and they'll make excuses"
@scalpatriot Amanda Carpenter I love to see her frustrated seeing Ted at 12% ha ha ha ha
Hey CNN you're crazy you think Hillary's going to be able to unite all those Bernie supporters who hate her gutts?
I love seeing the pendants on CNN gagging on trumps huge win in New York. Already they are suffering and making excuses
Bwahahahahahaha!!!! F you Ted! https://t.co/04mhqF5eK6

@Trump2Win @RynoOnAir @gcain63 @FoxNews Carl Cameron is a biased clown who is a spokeshole for Lindsey Graham and the inside crowd
Watch how the MSM signals what the results will be long before the polls are closed. You can tell how corrupt things are
All day the MSM has been pushing the narrative that women don't like Trump. They just keep pounding. I want to see them eat those words
Its torture to listen to the MSM today. These f'ing pundits are so biased and outspoken about it.
@mary_scots @Midgespeaks @sart48 @rjkok2 @rafshmatko We can have this conversation after Cruz drops out
