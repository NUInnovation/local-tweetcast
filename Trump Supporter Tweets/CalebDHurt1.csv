#TrumpTrain we must pray for @realDonaldTrump's life. I believe they will try and assassinate him. Which would be a stupid move... But PRAY!

@mitchellvii I thought the same except with Trump. (NOT saying he's bad) What if he's to bring about the deal for the 3rd Temple?
"@Cernovich @BenSasse I meant ""Nice"" about #PedoBen not being able to run. :) Not nice that Mitt might run..."
@Cernovich @BenSasse Nice!
@seanhannity And we love you Sean! Thank you for being fair and balanced. You're the best! So glad to see your ratings high as they are.
"@celiakw21 @realDonaldTrump @mitchellvii Exactly, and then he stabs it."
You #NeverTrump people aren't real Republicans but have always been idiot Liberal democrats hiding under the R banner. Get out of here!
Don't let this happen to you #America. Vote #Trump! You #NeverTrump people are part of the problem. https://t.co/xZDYKFwq22
@ItsRickOhio We do have one advantage though. Bernie supporters can't stand Hillary and will vote Trump over her or not vote at all.
https://t.co/xgJft31f6k
@ItsRickOhio I will remind you though that Reagan ran against a 3rd party candidate in 1980 and won.
@joshgremillion @magnifier661 @realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich @DanScavino Maybe... what about @AllenWest?
@seanhannity  These nevertrump people aren't with America they are against it. More than shame on them they're on the other side.
These #NeverTrump people are the slime of society!
@PatriotByGod Cruz's real base support is only about 8% maybe 10.
@Eyes_of_justice @KLSouth @TIMENOUT She can't drop out yet! If Trump runs against Bernie we lose! We need Hillary b/c she is so easy 2 beat
If you think you can buy Trump you're insane. #Trump2016 https://t.co/0FAjPcj2D0
@HouseCracka This is really good! https://t.co/0FAjPcj2D0
@NavyVets4Trump Or wherever he's from...
@NavyVets4Trump This little idiot is gonna have a rude awakening... when he finds himself in Mexico on the other side of a BIG wall!

A powerful message from Breitbart. To all you #NeverTrump traitors. https://t.co/9CXVdNvqYV
Exactly! #Trump2016 https://t.co/tavDFIUlgS
@_HankRearden @pmurph321 @Bidenshairplugs These people are not with US. They are the enemies of these united states.
@Cernovich Was this #PedoBen?
@Patriotic_Me I will give a moment of silence for you... you should wear a Trump shirt! :)
Pedophiles often like to work somewhere close to children. Ben Sasse sure did... #PedoBen https://t.co/roQfX2q1Ln
@magnifier661 @realDonaldTrump @elizabethforma #GoofyWarren is embarrassing!
@__The_Awakening @magnifier661 @WDFx2EU1 Ben is an IDIOT! Totally cares NOTHING about this country. He can get the *blank out of here!
@realDonaldTrump #TrumpTrain RT! https://t.co/dfw9i6vBq5
If you like Rick Perry or not this campaign ad of his from last election is epic! https://t.co/LIhwUZk8Lf
I'm so angry that they murdered him! YES murdered! We the people aren't STUPID! https://t.co/V4FLOaz8jq
#CruzCrew #Trump2016 https://t.co/IMRYfdGqrW
Rafael Cruz is a Cuban communist. He doesn't belong in this country.
#CruzCrew there is always more room for you on the #TrumpTrain. We must #Unite to defeat Hillary.
@vivelafra Good bye England... my heart breaks for you. I just pray our country doesn't come to your same fate. #Trump2016
#LyinTed  https://t.co/bABDO4U1RV
The only smart ones are the Trump supporters! :D Bernie people just want free stuff. :D https://t.co/QUfVpwWY0B
All of this thanks to Obama and Ryan. We need #Trump! https://t.co/StZj7SF7AC
@mitchellvii Good! I don''t want him any near Trump's cabinet!
"@StittJames That's your fall back line whenever you Cruz people are losing an argument ""You're a Liberal nanananana"" Okay, I'm done."
"@StittJames Okay, I'm done with you. Go do some research and stop acting like a child. B careful this country is on the brink of destruction"
"@StittJames Btw, you lost this argument when you stopped addressing the facts. I would encourage you to do some heavy research."
@StittJames You need help. Stop acting like a loser and help us defeat Hillary. This country is more important than your ego.
@StittJames You listen to Mark Levin!? :D The guy who was being funded to trash Trump... nice.
@StittJames What was? and by who?
@StittJames Get's his news from the NE!? That funny. What do you mean?
@StittJames He does NOT want a Dem as a VP. Don't be silly. Go listen to his interview today where is said he will NEVER pick a Dem. 2/2
"@StittJames He's not changing his tax plan. Yes, he did pay vets 1/2 the money and they are still figuring out who to give the rest to. 1/2"
"@StittJames Hmm.... and who's that sitting at the table I wonder??? That's right, Heidi Cruz. https://t.co/7VIpt5vEKb"
@StittJames Not to mention all the other stuff Heidi is involved in. https://t.co/XHjHdM71Lq
@StittJames And your comment about Trump being owned is hysterical. Trump is owned by nobody.
"@StittJames Cruz was still funded by Goldman Sachs and somehow mysteriously forgot to report the 1M loan. Btw, his wife still worked 4 them."
@StittJames And Trump did that because he now is in charge of raising money for the RNC. That's what that man is for.
@StittJames He also worked for Goldman Sachs. The same company who funded your man Cruz and who Heidi Cruz works for. 1/2
"@StittJames You are a sick traitor to this nation. You aren't #NeverTrump, you're really #NeverAmerica."
