@jpanzar to bad he didn't have gun to defend himself against those violent fascist thugs.
@IngrahamAngle @JulesRollTide They are not protestors. They are violent agitators determined to incite riots. They should be arrested for it
@Maggiemae_75 The counter protests of these fascist thugs is coming soon. It's not going to be pretty neither. They will meet a wall with us
@realDonaldTrump How dare the secret service &amp; FBI allow these violent anti American fascist to disrupt your right to assemble.
"@Trumptbird These so called protestors who are violent in the name of peace? This is America, not Mexico. The counter protests are coming!"
@Debramax @BeeGeefan1 Protests are peaceful. Those were violent fascist criminal agitators that need to be exported back to Mexico.
