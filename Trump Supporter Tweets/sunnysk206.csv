@Bravotv I liked her old look. She got too much flack about it though.
@Bravotv Don't care!!!

Trump is NOT a flash in the pan! Hillary is stiff and unapproachable and she is corrupt. Americans know that. Ted overplayed his hand wGOP.
@realtacoking25 @Campaign_Trump What do people see in her?
@Campaign_Trump @HillaryClinton It goes on and on
"@Campaign_Trump @HillaryClinton The devil is the father of lies, and she lies so what does that make her?"
@bazisgirl @Campaign_Trump @realDonaldTrump Oh my gosh! They don't look too excited...but we are! So thankful!
@Campaign_Trump Now we can breathe again.
"@Campaign_Trump They have so vilified Trump, Cruz has cursed Trump he feels he will be in alliance with the devil if he ever supported Trump"
@Andy @lisarinna I just deleted it. I wasn't too thrilled to see her on your show so I didn't watch.
@SenSanders It will cost too much to fund your fantasies. Why mislead these young people? America is better without a socialist.
@SC_bravo It's starting to leave me with a bad feeling.I don't know if I will watch SC anymore if there is continuous any more Kathryn drama
@realDonaldTrump We need someone in office to pay attention to Kim Jong Un. He is a danger waiting to happen I am concerned he will bomb us.
@godsgirltv Thank you!
@godsgirltv I like the Romeo Juliet kind of music you play. (harps) How many hours of sleep do you get every night?

@IamSantwon @LisaVanderpump @PumpRestaurant Beautiful!
@Serabbi @LisaVanderpump @LaurieBender19 @lisarinna @eileen_davidson @KyleRichards If she did she was probably joking
@KenToddBH @LisaVanderpump  LV is a blessing. She is classy and a supportive friend &amp;didn't deserve to be talked to &amp; treated that way.
@eileen_davidson I think you &amp; Lisa R were trying to win an Emmy or should have won an Emmy for your dramatization involving Lisa Vanderpump
@AnnCoulter Someone predicted that Jeb will be the Republican nominee.
@realDonaldTrump It's like a boxing match without you in it. Carly Fiorina is delivering punch after punch and Indiana is listening.
"@realDonaldTrump If Trump wins the nomination, he deserves it. He has worked hard enough for it."
"@AnnCoulter If Trump wins the nomination, he deserves it. He has worked hard enough for it."
@AnnCoulter Go Trump!
@AnnCoulter It's very refreshing and gives me hope!
@AnnCoulter We really should shout this from the housetops!
@AnnCoulter It does not make a bit of sense Ann. She talked like she was already elected the VP. Very strange. It gave Cruz a moment.
@AnnCoulter Wonder if Trump picks Rubio will he come with his delgates if it is contested and Rubio's supporters will then vote  for Trump?
@joshrodi @LisaVanderpump @lisarinna @eileen_davidson LV is confident $ not insecure like they R. I wish she could ignore their accusations.
@joshrodi @LisaVanderpump @lisarinna @eileen_davidson Lisa cant compete against these dramatic actresses. Like she says she cant win.
@joshrodi @LisaVanderpump @lisarinna @eileen_davidson I bet Ken cant stand how these women treat his wife. They are so unkind.
