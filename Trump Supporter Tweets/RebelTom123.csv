@TrumpTrain8 @wendyvoss ...Trump vs. Killary.
@NcsndczBrown  Thank you sir.  @realDonaldTrump
Who is the real enemy to @realDonaldTrump ?  Is it KILLARY or the GOP elites such as @BillKristol ?  The two K's are two peas in a pod.
@zesty_leftwing @zesty_republic Funny...Killary will be in prison Way Beyond 2016.
"@BillKristol , I don't respect you anymore.  Your existence has become sad, bitter, and pathetic."
@JohnKasich Oh good Lord.  You need to do the right thing and drop out now.
I see the narrative is still the same.  Sigh. https://t.co/7Qot2IbpXp
"@amandacarpenter , that's simply not true.  I am extremely conservative and I will fight like hell to make sure KILLARY is NOT elected."
"@DLoesch , I hope you get over the anger you have inside soon.  You would be a valuable asset to help defeat #KILLARY.  #GOPUNITY"
@Kaduku6 @AmerPatriot1 and this is how the sour grapes work.  You get blocked even when civil.  Sad and pathetic.
"@Kaduku6 @AmerPatriot1 Seriously man?  You want to invoke ""Godless"" and you admitted you'll vote for KILLARY?  SMH"
@HarveyAckerman Good stuff Harvey!
@Kaduku6 @AmerPatriot1 Obviously your prerogative.  God Speed.

"Like @realDonaldTrump, it is time to unify ALL of us.  Knocking @SenTedCruz serves no purpose now.  Time to focus on defeating Killary."
@ed_hooley Nah.  Kasich has zero chance.  Time to finish off KILLARY.
