@SomaliDuchess I voted for Obama in 2008 for the same reason I'm voting for Trump. But Obama promised change that he didn't deliver

@ringod01 They won't because it helps them to be middle the waters
@mitchellvii @sunserger exactly my thought! No one cares about ideologies when they can't find jobs
The GOPe must support Trump on his terms. They should know they can't out-negotiate the brilliant negotiator! #AlwaysTrump #CrookedHillary

@BillKristol what a total moron. Arrogant fool
@JulieYankee that's very sad. Discrimination is bad regardless where it's coming from. Say no to Affirmative Action now!

@1unitedrepublic Wrong analogy. Politics isn't Religion. Stop confusing the two
"@1unitedrepublic of course, we do. But it's a misconception to think that all economic conservatives share the views of social conservatives"
Someone was on radio saying he doesn't like Trump because Trump divorced and remarried. And he was told his idol Reagan did the same üòÅ

@IndieThinker2 oh they're doing it but the media isn't reporting it!
Hillary is no champion for women. She viciously attacked and humiliated the women Bill abused in order to bolster her political ambitions!
