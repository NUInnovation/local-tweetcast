@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump going to Richmond Saturday to promote Trump I'm from Ohio. INDIANA  VOTE  TRUMP
@DRUDGE_REPORT @ChatRevolve @NBCNews if that's the only way I could keep my job is by someone telling me to support Cruz. I'd quit !
@gatewaypundit @LindaSuhler they should  be first to get deported if here illegally
@MSNBC Now it's time to do a little jail time and community service or send them to fight https://t.co/k4Ly9aV3Ca them protest  then.
@EricTrump @DanScavino @politico

@kirstiealley just got a little more desperate
@RubinReport @EndorsementsGOP just another Cruz mistake among many. Too many to count.i think he's brain dead pull plug
@mitchellvii @Kotcha301 Rubio knows a winner when he sees one . I'll give him credit for that. Just think if he &amp; Trump partnered  16yrs Gop
@KLSouth @LindaSuhler I really think he does think he is the chosen one. GOD and the American people know better
@thehill poor John  bet his heart is broken oh that's right he didn't want to be VP.
@foxnewspolitics @FoxNews now that is a real match up who in their right mind would vote for them .two of a kind
@CNN need help packing. You would get all the Trump help you need. Maybe even a ride
@DefendingtheUSA @LindaSuhler @TruthFeedNews he's a delusional idiot.Very bad temper .Vote TRUMP FOR AMERICA
@WilburTwoNose @LindaSuhler @kayleighmcenany @scottienhughes the will of the people is stronger than being about the delegates.  Cruz u suck
@DiamondandSilk @LindaSuhler @heytana @wolfblitzer I'm from Ohio and they can keep . He's a.looserlike cruz
@misterdish69 @JoanieChesnutt @jimlibertarian @KamVTV Birds  of a feather flock together . Cheat .lie . Steal.
@leftardsHQ @JoanieChesnutt Trump is right on a lot of things. Especially how corrupt  our government is.
@BOSSYtxmar55 @LindaSuhler Give him a chance  and he will beat her for sure. AMERICA IS FED of with politics as usual
@GovMikeHuckabee At this point of campaign they need to focus on the opposition not the competition!
@ellenEspence @ChatRevolve Get everyone out to vote Trump. I'm from Ohio and Kasich really pissed me off .Real low life
The difference  between USA AND CUBA IS THAT CASTRO NEVER PRETENDED THAT PEOPLE  HAD A CHOICE.
Babies diapers and politicians should be changed on regular basis for same reason .
Apparently politicians are the lowest form of life on earth.AMERICA WISE UP .VOTE TRUMP TO SAVE AMERICA BEST CHOICE..  ONLY CHOICE
@foxnewspolitics @AdamShawNY Two big low lifes. Never thought our governor would stoop  that low.  Two more insiders
@greta @tedcruz @JohnKasich @FoxNews backfire. There is only one candidate now that is an outsider .
@RogerJStoneJr @tedcruz Cruz you suck. Now Trump is only candidate that is an out side. You may have f____ up!
@gatewaypundit @LindaSuhler must have been free. In my book he is a low life cheat just like Cruz  .
"Rubio should join Trump A real winning team . TRUMP is not two faced .come on America  let's show them who's boss. Get on Trump team!
."
"What respect I had for Kasich is gone .will ruin him as a nominee to team with such a low life
Thought he was a better person 
Truth is out"
"Cruz is the devil in disguise. He makes me sick .such a low life
Kasich  isn't much better .shows how desperate  they are. VOTE TRUMP"
@BorisEP @LindaSuhler @realDonaldTrump it just shows how desperate they are and two faced.Trump is the real deal
@MsB971 @LindaSuhler @MichaelCohen212 @tedcruz I feel the same way. He's enough to give you nightmares.go back to Texas you cheater
@RogerJStoneJr @realDonaldTrump that's the only way he could get them. He would be just as bad as president.God help us!
This will change course of our country for the best. Americans please vote to save America  and make it great again VOTE TRUMP
This is first time In 8 yrs. Gop has had someone strong enough and smart enough to wake up American  voters.Trump will make a great leader !
@BonnieMadden @Kotcha301 I'm from Ohio and it's no better. He won't do any better as president.  We need TRUMP !
@MichaelCohen212 @DefendingtheUSA @tedcruz when Obama got elected I had to go blood pressure  pills . Lordy what politics  can . VOTE TRUMP!
@TheFive @JohnKasich no. The only reason he is is to keep his delegates from going to Trump if he drops out
@TheFive @HillaryClinton bull shit.I never killed anyone . Every time I see her I see the four faces who died because of her choices
@realDonaldTrump How incredible.  Brought me to tears to see how much love and support our people have for you.
Someone took my TRUMP SIGN FROM MY YARD LAST NITE. * BIG MISTAKE *THEY WON'T NO MORE.  I GET EVEN.DOOGGIE DO WILL PREVAIL!

@greta @realDonaldTrump @AriFleischer @FoxNews you either love him or you don't!  His voters are really loyal and I'm  proud to be one.
@greta @GOPLeader @FoxNews California could be the big Kauhauna for America. You need to vote Trump please save America
@greta @JamesRosenFNC @FoxNews The only reason Kasich is staying in is to prevent Trump from getting his delegates  we're  not stupid.
@THEHermanCain The only path we want him to take is go south back to Texas. AMERICA ONLY WANTS TRUMP / NO CRUZ
John Kaisick why don't you do America a favor  GO back to Ohio and do a job you can handle. Let a real man get in the White House.TRUMP!
https://t.co/lCeOoyzptn
