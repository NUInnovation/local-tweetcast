@ABC @tedcruz Video of him punching wife? Eating booger? Crying day he suspended? Daughter recoiling in horror? Awkward hand hold w/ Carly?
@DanScavino @LindseyGrahamSC People really come unglued when they get beat by Trump. The rich elite can't believe us poor voters beat them!
@SpeakerRyan I was 16 when my mom died &amp; I've never gotten over it. She taught me many things in that short time like always keep your word.
@mcasil2016 Sounds a little testy
@KledisaHasa @sabine_durden @theonlyraindove *accept. If you're going to make insulting statements at least be grammatically correct.
@FSM1988 Name calling - always a compelling argument.
@FSM1988 Facts distract you. Got it.
@NetworksManager @DonaldjBismarck Coming soon to the USA.
@HillaryClinton The mothers of these poor men still have so many questions. https://t.co/HfKfSkexlJ

"@JimHumbert @Sari_Swensen @gatewaypundit Feels so great that the Bush money couldn't buy this election. with 2cents to my name, I mattered!"
@TrumpTrain8 @kinni00 @SpeakerRyan @pnehlen Great! Link? Statement? Tweet?
@TrumpTrain8 @kinni00 @SpeakerRyan @pnehlen Did Nehlen endorse Trump? I didn't think so and that's why I've stopped pushing for him.
@originalYoni Copying Trump again with the knockout blow. Only his was to his wife.
@BKFishmaster @clmazin @CarlyFiorina with sloppy seconds. I believe @amandacarpenter was proffering that on @CNN . Truth:Cruz is unelectable
@SenJohnMcCain I respect you for your service &amp; sacrifice. The truth is you haven't done much for America &amp; vets while in Senate.
"@ChanceJerry @rharrisonfries @susanfae @saskamare She didn't just oppose war, she opposed our sons who were DRAFTED &amp; had the courage to go."
@FSM1988 @azqueen57Sandy Educate yourself. This was one scary lady. And you libs call Trump Hitler? https://t.co/UtheKRSV7P
@HillaryClinton says she'll have to call her husband out of retirement to help her figure out how to creat jobs. So much for strong women.
@tedcruz 's side piece @amandacarpenter says VP pick should have been Rubio. Throwing @CarlyFiorina hard under bus with @heidiscruz
"@SpeakerRyan Taking Ryan a while to get there - to be ready. It's not the first time, according to his wife."
"@PatDollard @SpeakerRyan Please provide proof. If true, very serious. If false, not something to hint at no matter how loathsome Ryan is."
@CNN @SarahPalinUSA Never been a fan but she hit it out of the park for @realDonaldTrump today!
@Gypsydragup @thehill @WERStanford @MittRomney disgraced himself by making dirty jokes about Melania.
@CNN Joe Borelli on point!!!!! Many many candidates eat ethnic foods in solidarity with the community.
@jaketapper You insult the American voter when you think all we want is a comic book style cage match. Smug and intellectually elitist.
@Eagle_Vision @OPMpaul @elizabethforma ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Lie-a-watha
@amandacarpenter @CNN Its Mother's Day. Respecting married women with children MATTERS. @heidiscruz https://t.co/PW32nSXG0G
@amandacarpenter @CNN Are you really talking about the infidelity issue? YOU? Respectful to women? https://t.co/nbC1VKgTaC
@Reince Moms everywhere want a safe America and jobs for our kids. Get ahold of your party and get behind TRUMP!
@amandacarpenter @CNN Why you allow this woman who disrespects her marriage and her children on the air? https://t.co/h5mRCuiADX
@CBSNews @HillaryClinton True! We'd like to help you lose but you're doing a great job by yourself
@realDonaldTrump @CLewandowski_ @DanScavino Jan Brewer is great but NOT a good charismatic speaker. Please find someone else for tv spots.
@CNN @amandacarpenter how do you let this unqualified mouth / side piece on the air? She has no credibility. https://t.co/EnzFlRWWwn
@mitchellvii Plus Carson's color and Palin's V.
@StatesPoll Amazing how the media and pundits discount the Asian vote.

@SteveKingIA @unevereverno @tedcruz And of the alleged 15 million how many are for Cruz? I don't think you understand the math.
@DRNashAuthor @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/avsiCRLcgy
@Lagartija_Nix @realDonaldTrump YES! And that's why I will vote for him AND donate to HIS CAMPAIGN only. Not RNC.
"@syoka68 ""There's always one in the crowd"" Lying again. What crowd?"
"@gorgashouse @SpeakerRyan ""true conservative"" ""grassroots"" ""ground game"" all euphemisms for GOPe bought &amp; paid for like Ryan the RINO."
@slaboe @KatTimpf @Harvard Agree with you. Smart. Wish you dressed more professionally. Your brains will get you the attention you seek.
@DailyMail @realDonaldTrump @PaulManafort @CLewandowski_ Campaign needs to organize. If 3 million supporters gave $300 he wouldn't need GOP$
@thehill Aren't we still paying him to be a Senator? At what other job can you not show up for a year &amp; not be missed &amp; still get paid?
@foxandfriends oh she's a woman. Help the poor woman? If @realDonaldTrump said that you'd call him sexist.
@teamrope @SheilaH92013461 @RichardTBurnett @switherel His campaign needs to raise money for general so we don't need GOPe @realDonaldTrump
@KatTimpf All the men on @foxandfriends are wearing business suits. Why are you wearing a super short tight sleeveless sun dress?
@DefendingtheUSA @realDonaldTrump @crimson_i_m So smart!! Awesome!
@gabino_58 @livefree369 @dilemmv https://t.co/VGbG1bxvBT
@thee88plyr @NAARobertWilson @Patrici15767099 He didn't. He mentioned an article that said Rafael might have known Oswald. That's it.
@cologop @SteveHouseGOP Curious if there are any updates on the Twitter hacker investigation? Maybe it was #Guccifer
@jazz1294u @BigStick2013 That will only make Trump stronger. @MittRomney couldn't win on the GOPe ticket he thinks he'll win on 3D party?
@TweetN4Trump @kyramarat1 Yup they repeat sound bites from his speeches (albeit out of context). We heard it the 1st time. We voted for him!
@Cronikeys She really can't handle the pressure. It's GREAT!!
@bobb2526 @micah_micahk @realDonaldTrump Let's get this trending: #Guccifer
@mitchellvii How can we raise money for ONLY Trump so he doesn't need Ryan or anyone else? $300 x 3 million people would do it. Thoughts?
"@kyramarat1 They really don't get it at all. Like nick naming him ""dangerous"" Don - made him sound cool. Her campaign is the WORST!"
@Zarabette @rharrisonfries @WestJournalism Its a shakedown! This arrogant POS doesn't care about principles. It's all about the $$
@JudgeJeanine I love you. That call to your mom was precious!!!!
@HillaryClinton @Guccifer
@HillaryClinton @DVF @evafehren How presumptuous. And always shilling your crap. You're going to jail lady!
@SpeakerRyan You are selfish and immature. This isn't a policy issue. It's a shakedown. You're a jackass!!
@realDonaldTrump If we can raise $ for Mr. Trump we don't need the GOPe. With millions of us we can do it! 300 x 3million gets us there!
"@realDonaldTrump Let's get some fundraising going for Mr. Trump ONLY. Money talks! Srsly, 300 x 3 million people gets us there."
@JudgeJeanine Thank God for you! It IS a shakedown! I'm so glad you speak the truth.
@SavySoapBox @PlaysTrumpCard @JebBush @DRJAMESCABOT @realDonaldTrump They can't stand that all their money couldn't buy Jeb! Or Ted!
@JohnRiversToo Fuckin' bullshit Jersey's only orange. Dafuck?
@elizabethforma wait - weren't YOU the one who lied??
@NewportLost @vivelafra @CNBC This strengthens him in many ways. The people WANT him to rail against party. We need to help with $!
@thehill They are so scared of the end to the gravy train. Conservative principles my a$$! @MittRomney a disgrace.
@HillaryClinton pandering https://t.co/552JpzDcOZ
@SebastianJRusso @Chris11962 @edwiley1960 @SchonhoS @ArRuple @LindseyGrahamSC As an Italian I would NOT be offended at all. Grow up.
@RufusKings1776 @mitchellvii He's 92. He fought and was injured in WWII for us. I'm not a fan - but I do respect his service to our country.
@AJDelgado13 @HillaryClinton How do minorities and women not find her completely offensive.
@mitchellvii @NBCNews You know he didn't want to but he did! Just like we did for him and W. So disappointed in George HW Bush.
"@ForTennessee Barriers to voting? undermines the struggle of law abiding citizens who fought to vote. You know, like in CO primary @cologop"

@Yeeeeeech @unclebubba9 @SpeakerRyan @HeidiL_RN @ThomascburtBurt @Orangeone4 @Trumptbird @pnehlen Does he back Trump? Mixed messages.
@mitchellvii Not to many in GOP. Sad. Sessions?
@secupp @CNN The party abandoned us. Conservative? Bought into every Obama initiative. The party is done. The people want Trump
@larryelder @heavenlyitalian @danjdob There will be some on both sides. But to insult an entire group based on no facts is itself prejudiced
@Conservative_VW @TrumpSelfFunds But I'm not sure Nehlen did either. He's going to have to do that
@RealJamesWoods @jpodhoretz Vote Trump!!
@JackBPR poor losers. They asked us to support W and we did. NO HONOR. I'm surprised at HW.
