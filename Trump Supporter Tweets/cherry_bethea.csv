@Scarlett210 @Momstaxi104 @marylene58 Rubio did not think Cruz would beat Hillary.
@wallaceme @billpostmus Your problem is that Muslim voters will increase far more than others.
@Koxinga8 @ceci8775 yes.  Compassion was never meant to be suicidal. Europeans totally failed by their countries' leaders.
"So, Trump must be destroyed-he does not want a borderless USA. Everyone has 3rd world life but upper crust like Kerry, Obama's etc? Madness."
@SecKerry Do me a favor. Sell all you have. Live like the poor. Then give ur speech on borderless world.
Read Putin will give free land in Russia to disillusioned Brits if they want to move there.

@greta @peachesgirli23 Obama has put on a Horror Show. Only groups to make progress: wealthy and Islam.
