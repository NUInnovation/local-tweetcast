@MargaretsBelly @TheyCallMeDSP it'll probably take 1 minute and 57 seconds to blow over.
"@ChristiChat @LindaSuhler @MrBlack_n_Right Liberals, with MSM's help, have turned words like nationalism and patriotism into pejoratives."
@Cernovich looks like she's being yanked down.
"@WayneDupreeShow if elected, Hillary will fight racism by utilizing c.p. time to keep superpredators from leaving the reservation."
@Jamie_Weinstein @benshapiro this is way worse than Clinton/Bernie supporters assaulting people and vandalizing property. What a savage.
@clmazin @kinja The stage outsourced her. Lol
@TheFoundingSon a socialist utopia.

@kayleighmcenany great job on CNN yet again!
@DineshDSouza @YahooNews wouldn't it look better to be proven innocent before the election so it's not a negative distraction? Why delay...
