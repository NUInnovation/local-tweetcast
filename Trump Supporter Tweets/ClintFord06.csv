@willbarrett_1 @pnehlen Very true... Very true  👍
@willbarrett_1 @pnehlen It's too bad we can't just tear down completely and start off new with new people and rebuild
@willbarrett_1 @pnehlen I would hate to know how many of our politicians are bought William... It's pretty much like connecting dots
"@bambam4267 @PaulettePennyp2 @guyeronthemoney @Trump2016Donald You call people ""Nutbags""???... You really sound intelligent 👌👌"
@bambam4267 @PaulettePennyp2 @guyeronthemoney @Trump2016Donald I'm not the one being childish and calling people names
@940heidi @Artemisrecords @bfraser747 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @PRyan People need to retweet this as much as possible!!
@royalistajoe @hexagonthai1944 @940heidi @NetworksManager that are going on in Germany...  They refuse to fight back
@royalistajoe @hexagonthai1944 @940heidi @NetworksManager They wont... A German citizen told me yesterday she knows nothing about rapes...
@940heidi @NetworksManager @royalistajoe It's safe to say that Love has no boundaries but Power has no morals 👌👌

@Derek_McBrien @vannsmole Well go to Israel and attack them for it...
@Derek_McBrien @vannsmole You act like you're telling me something that I don't know...
@Derek_McBrien @vannsmole Sorry guess what??... People already know the media only puts certain things out
@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist Here we go again... Now bring slavery into it.  👏👏👏
@Derek_McBrien @vannsmole I already stated that fact... Many people say nothing because they want to avoid trouble
@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist You're the type of person that gets offended by the truth and cannot talk civil

@Derek_McBrien @vannsmole Every religion has bad and good???... That's exactly why you think the way you do
@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist I could go on and on but all you'll do is attack me for telling you the truth
@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist People have been dying for no reason whatsoever for a long time and for many reasons
@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist It's people like you one way or another that go around with an attitude

@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist I'm tired of our country taking care of everyone else yet all they do is turn around and kill us
@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist I say just go ahead and keep it over there and kill each other until nobody's left
"@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist But just because we don't accept Islam is no excuse to behead people, burn them alive rape women"

"@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist Not understand the ""bits"" I'm supposed to??... You just agreed with me about the martyrs"
@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist You just proved my point... All the suicide bombers are considered martyrs
@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist I'm 100% I read it... and several times to make sure I understood it correctly
@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist Everything has been well planned and carried out and it's always a guessing game of when and where
@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist And how about the man that took out all of his stock of the towers right before 9/11???...
@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist I already know there was people responsible but you can't blame it all on him
@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist It was security but don't tell me he flew the planes and killed thousands of people that day
"@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist The mosques... It's easy, they are killing people for deception... the oldest trick there is"
@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist And receiving 72 virgins just for killing people???

@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist That's old news... There are cells and sleepers in every state... That's old news
"@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist The main topic is they are trying to take over... slowly, 1 country at a time and then the U.S."
@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist Some people are intimidated but I will not kneel and let another man cut my throat or shoot me
"@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist If you don't want to admit it fine, but that's why countries are falling apart"
@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist Now that there's a Muslim mayor he's specifically saying no whites??... That's clear to see
"@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist So it's just coincidence that the ""terrorists"" have been Muslim???"

@Derek_McBrien @janimine @VetApologist Here in America when people get killed they go to jail and stay in jail
