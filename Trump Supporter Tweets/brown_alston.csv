@FoxNews oh no! I am worried! He's going to lose the election with all of their 4 supporters! ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜©
@WDFx2EU1 @kupajo322 @DanScavino PLEASE let Mr. Trump use this as a campaign ad.
@mitchellvii share this video of Bill Clinton's alleged victim of rape telling her story. https://t.co/XhQIKgHtI6
Every Hillary supporter needs to watch this. #ImWithHer #Hillary2016 #HillaryClinton https://t.co/XhQIKgHtI6
@LoriW66 https://t.co/XhQIKgHtI6
@LoriW66 ever heard of Bill's rape victims?
"@DudeInDistress beside the point, Trump wasn't the POTUS during his marriages. Also, Trump doesn't have rape allegations."
"@CBSNews @HillaryClinton enough to know she's a lying, killing, evil BITCH!"
@JudgeJeanine is awesome! Best person in the news media! #judgejeanine #FoxNews
@NextGenUSA360 @FoxNews no he's not. He's 1 pt ahead. That's not losing.
@thehill why is this a shock? Lol. It's been tight in Georgia in 2008 and 2012.
@asamjulian it better not! This election has really opened up people's eyes at how crooked the establishment is.
@asamjulian @DanScavino @scottienhughes ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ #NeverHillary #AlwaysTrump https://t.co/7ouy2erIMr
@realDonaldTrump @Teamsters thank you Mr. President!
@FoxNews @SheriffClarke Trump/Clarke 2016!ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
"@asamjulian agreed. I tried yesterday but I gave up. If you don't vote Trump over Killary, you're a damn fool."
@thehill God this election is going to be fun!
@HillaryClinton @SadiqKhan you suck KILLARY!
@newtgingrich @seanhannity @FoxNews great job on Hannity! TRUMP/GINGRICH 2016! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
Thank you Dick Cheney! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain
"@bycon11 @FoxNews says a Hillary Clinton supporter. I respect dems but Hillary, really?"
@PpollingNumbers @thehill well that's a given. Lol
@Stand4Justice1 of our American Soldiers.
"@Stand4Justice1 will all due respect ma'am/sir, Mr. Trump is not being investigated by the FBI and he is also not responsible for 4 lives"
"@Stand4Justice1 @dhiggins63 I ask you to please vote for Mr. Trump. A write in is a vote for that killing, lying, evil woman Hillary Clinton"
@thehill thank you @RealBenCarson!
"@Cronikeys I'm confused? So now, people don't have to vote in the primaries for him to get 1237?"
@asamjulian that's what I was wondering. Does he not have to win any more states?
Disappointed in you @SpeakerRyan. #Unite #NeverHillary
@mitchellvii @bi_politics @daturkel and he'll get the General Election wrong too.
@NateSilver538 remember when you said Trump wasn't going to secure the nomination before June?
@asamjulian @HillaryClinton I love being able to now focus on Killary. She's such an easy target!
@HillaryClinton shut up Killary. I can't wait for Trump to shred your political career.
@TrumpTrain8 yes and what happens when Sanders drops out? Hillary is in trouble whether she realizes it now or not! #NeverClinton #Trump2016
@IvankaTrump thank you for your dad wanting to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
@DanScavino now to defeat Crooked Hillary! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
@thehill #PervertBill #Trump2016
@HelenKennedy looks like they did lol
@NateSilver538 wow. You were so wrong. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
This is freaking awesome! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ @mitchellvii @asamjulian @RealDJSlash  https://t.co/GphK6JuE4W
@asamjulian she used people in her ad that Trump has DESTROYED over the last 11 months. This is going to be a fun 6 months! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
@Nate_Cohn they were tied in a PA poll in April. https://t.co/NvYBrULOuM
@thehill that's cool. I hope he does put his name on the White House.
@BornToBeGOP now for Hillary!
@CloydRivers #Trump2016 ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
@thehill it won't hurt him. As soon as he exposes Clinton he will win the White House!
@thehill #Trump2016
"Now it's time for the good stuff, taking down CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON! ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬"
@MillennialTrump that's going to be weird when a candidate not running wins a state.
"@MillennialTrump I'm confused, why wouldn't Trump win Nebraska now?"
@asamjulian @ModelNikeeLynn I love Ross' leather pants scene ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ https://t.co/0i4luqcWzs
@mitchellvii I was just watching that! Wth?
Why the hell is Carly speaking?! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
@thehill lol he's losing by 22 pts to Trump right now in Indiana! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
@mitchellvii now if Cruz would wise up and drop out tonight!
Donald Trump is the Republican Nominee. #INPrimary #Trump2016 #Vote
Remember the Mike Down's poll? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ #INPrimary #TrumpTrain #LyinTed #Trump2016
@thehill can we not focus on Trump killing his son right now in the Indiana primary?
@kendall_downing wow they're going to be disappointed.
"Why are they talking about this Lee Harvey Oswald stuff? Ugh, Trump is getting ready to secure the GOP nomination and this is the topic! ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’"
@MillennialTrump WOW! I hope these numbers hold the entire night! ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬
@MillennialTrump I'm scared to look lol
@asamjulian is it true early votes are coming in at 6? I didn't know just heard that on Twitter.
@thehill awesome. Makes me want Trump more!
@meetthepress @HillaryClinton where Donald Trump is going to crush you.
@ForecasterEnten where is the Cruz HQ dumpster fire? ðŸ˜‚
@Cronikeys the only thing I worry about is Ted doing better than expected because of early voting that started pre-NY win for DT.
"@MillennialTrump yeah I know. I'm still worried about tonight. Honestly, I wouldn't be blown away if Cruz pulled off a slight victory."
"@thehill When I'm losing (dramatic pause), I like to scream and yell and throw insults! -Ted Cruz"
@thehill #DESPERATE ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
@asamjulian ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ https://t.co/FxT9OKJl6z
@thehill if Teds dad is as creepy as he is I wouldn't even doubt it.
@Limeylizzie @thehill he's beating Hillary 41 to 39 in new poll also though.
"@Maegan_C0024 oh please, your delusional, if Trump wins tomorrow he will EASILY make it beyond 1237."
@asamjulian this is how we know it's fake. Kasich with 87% of the vote in one county. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ https://t.co/EMD3rvX58p
"@EdWorthy10 the only thing that concerned me about early voting was this, if true, https://t.co/VV6ztcTxrh"
@EdWorthy10 will the first results in tomorrow night be good for Cruz?
"@EdWorthy10 I have a question, since the first results tomorrow will be early voting and it started the day after Cruz Wisconsin win..."
@asamjulian since the early voting started on April 5th the day before Cruz Wisconsin win; wonder how much that will affect the 1st results
@thehill it's over folks!
@thehill just stop! He didn't mock her! He simply said she fell and Ted didn't get her up or even look at her.
@mitchellvii @asamjulian @scottienhughes wow. Trump +34 in CA! https://t.co/ynEr8Jd3ha
@thehill god he's desperate. Can't wait for his political career to end tomorrow night.
You know it over if Karl Rove says it's over. https://t.co/4mnv44gzwK
@asamjulian that's awesome! I would love to tell him what I think to his face. It would be a great honor lol!
@meetthepress @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Trump beating Clinton in new poll today. At this point I truly believe either one of them.
@thehill Ted Cruz is the Bernie Sanders of the Republican Party.
@krystalth2183 new Indiana poll just out! https://t.co/ATv0Kk5rn9
https://t.co/ATv0Kk5rn9 New Indiana poll- Trump 44%    Cruz 27%! @mitchellvii @asamjulian @PpollingNumbers @DanScavino @RealDJSlash
@thehill it's happening. #Trump2016
"@thehill the man speaks the truth, can't deny that."
@daveweigel reminds me of Marco Rubio in the days leading up to Florida.
@daveweigel poor man. Wonder if he knows it's over?
"@PpollingNumbers @ppppolls wow, Trump is closing the gap big time."
"@thehill it's true. If Trump had said, ""I've handled women that has went off the reservation."" The media would blow up over it."
"@rothfarms barely, but he won it. https://t.co/QvavzzLfna"
"@CarrieNBCNews he's at 1,002 delegates according to CNN. Which one is it? 996 or 1,002? Thanks."
@thehill but thank God your winning it!
@rothfarms it might be very conservative but Obama won it in 2008.
@thehill and Trump and Clinton are tied within the MOE. Mention that one.
@PredictIt_ Trump 100% new PPP poll they are tied within MOE in Ohio! He's also leading in FL. Trump will win unless something major happens
