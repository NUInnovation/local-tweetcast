"@Artledesma2 @jCar89000  Don't blame them, they are lost in the wilderness. They don't have a leader. Trump will lead them when he is POTUS!"
"@RogerJStoneJr Trump promised that he would keep winning and he has! I'm so hungry to win, I can taste it!"
"@Johnatsrs1949 A weak country makes ppl weak! We need a strong arm, like Donald Trump! Make America and our ppl Great Again!"
@Chris_D2 Without a doubt. Don't know why anyone would vote Hillary.She believes in killing babies 1 hour before they are born! Enough said!
@Johnatsrs1949 I'm Rejoicing with pride. I'm looking at the media having a melt down and thinking what's wrong with you?
@mitchellvii @VermillionRich Ego must never come before country!
@Jeff_Neil525 Trump will be the 45th president of the USA. You prayed for an act of God.
@Natalia12696442 @Spirit_of_1776_ Ppl just don't understand how businessman work. Oval Office is a business.Politicians belong in Congress.
@Jeff_Neil525  God just answered your prayer.
"@jjauthor We all know USA is a country of immigrants. The ? now about immigration is, do we have enough, need more, or just about right?"
"@theonlyraindove No president has ever known how to make congress fund securing our country, or build a wall. Trump does and he will!"
@theonlyraindove No. I was just quoting another of my  favorite Vince Lombardi quotes.
@TrumpTrain8 @MOVEFORWARDHUGE Rubio probably turned him down!  2 Cuban anchor babies? Hum!
@NickRicci5 It's a lot harder to be a playwrite than to be a critic-Vince Lombardi.... Great coach!
@theonlyraindove @Chris11962 What has he done lately to make a difference for people with his non-racist self!
"@watchdoggy I'm a Woman, Hispanic, and Trump supporter from Day 1.If that is the label you want to put on me, I wear it as a badge of HONOR!"
@AlyLovesMovies he promised us that he would keep winning and he did!
@wendyfarrier1 Oh no! So that's why he wants to move out of the USA! He owes taxes!
@ajfromhouston maybe another mini stroke!
@RepStevenSmith Hillarey is for abortion as late as 1 hour before birth! This alone is enough for me to despise her!
@Johnatsrs1949 God Bless the Donald Trump Family!

"@LindaSuhler @Bohoover If Hillary is the one we can trust, we are really in trouble!"
@DouglasSchroed1 @ThePushReport politicians that won't support Trump r the ones that don't care about the people at all! No more gravy train
@DouglasSchroed1 @ThePushReport politician that won't support Trump r seeing their gravy train end.They don't care about people at all.

"@realDonaldTrump I love to hear you say ""I love you, I love you people"" nobody else says that. I love you more!"
@realDonaldTrump Maybe Bernie Sanders 3rd party! Have these ppl not learned yet that voters r rejecting their traditional estbmt lane favs!
@realDonaldTrump That would be awesome. Hillary and Warren! Neither is trustworthy! Build the wall! No political correctness!
