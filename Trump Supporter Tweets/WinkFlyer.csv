@Suthen_boy Ummmm....me thinks he should condemn ISIS style attacks.  But I doubt that will happen.
Bella is for sure on the Trump Train!! https://t.co/qbh17Unqt6

@realDonaldTrump It won't be the same way Mr Trump....because you WILL be the President. #45!
@AngryAmerican97 he won't resign...Ryan like all the establishment politicians are dug in tighter than a tick on a dog's rear end.
@realDonaldTrump @NYC4TRUMP2016 Lets let her do the research https://t.co/R0hmcbmik4
"To all of you who have Moms still living, visit her if you can, if you can't then call her.  Above all let her know you love her!! Thanks."
@WellmanOne @GPsait JR...I wouldn't waste my time on this one.  She probably bathes once a week and has the Don King look in each arm pit.
Is anyone surprised London elected a muslim mayor?  The U.S. has had a muslim president for the past seven years....just sayin'
"@ImagineAnna @CajunKangaroo Dang Anna, Hillary won't be happy with you talking about her squaw.  :)"

@FrankKOMO dude needs a bra for those man boobs he's sportin
@seanhannity @JoshMcCall_ Sean arguing with these folks is like wrestling with a pig in the mud..after a bit u realize the pig likes it :)
@OnlyHotyP I hope this idiot enjoys his time with the Secret Service!  Mom was right....you just can't fix STUPID!!!
Linnnnndsey?  Where is your hand???? https://t.co/xwvGZ5oMEy
@BarbieKeleigh @LindaSuhler @Ricky_Vaughn99 @RaisingLiberty @mtracey Thank you for sharing this.
Bella is officially on the Trump Train!! https://t.co/r21CLuXnxq
@Campaign_Trump @glennbeck @Buckles2016 Maybe it was the Cheetos whispering to him that Cruz would be the nominee.
@Campaign_Trump @glennbeck @Buckles2016 One word for Beck......Pathetic
@Cronikeys @blairanton And I'm guessing the main stream liberal media hasn't reported this.  Imagine that.
@drewbarham43 Go Drew!!! Proud of you Bud!!  Awesome video !
@WDFx2EU1 @LindaSuhler @glennbeck I still think making terrorist listen to Beck for a few hours would be more effective than water boarding.
@NavyVets4Trump @WellmanOne @maxlydic Yes he is Mr. Corley...and thank you Sir for your service!!!!
"@realDonaldTrump hmmmm I would resurrect ""lyin'"" as in Lyin' Liz"
https://t.co/NekXzajz2o via @youtube I'm guessing the establishment republicans are having a very similar conversation...too funny!!!!
@RogerJStoneJr @prolifewill @realDonaldTrump AGREED!!!
"@Wild_Phil @RichardTBurnett @realDonaldTrump Seems we're learning who the ""True Americans"" are in politics and who isn't.  Thank u Sen Dole."
https://t.co/NekXza1XDO via @youtube Sort of the conversation the establishment is having now about Trump.
https://t.co/NekXza1XDO via @youtube Sort of the conversation the establishment is having right now about Trump.
@denofthieves80 @RichardTBurnett @realDonaldTrump Exactly!!!
Hillary rally shut down by Bernie supporters earlier today.  Wonder why main stream media isn't reporting it...  https://t.co/CleNyzsBeM
@RichardTBurnett Trump will pull those pants down and spank that behind.
@greta @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Senator Graham needs to remember Mr Trump won S Carolina.  Strom Thurmond days are long gone.
I haven't seen Ben Shapiro at all lately....Bueller? Bueller?
@realDonaldTrump I wonder if Speaker Ryan will seek your endorsement for his re-election down the road...when you're the President.  Hmmmm
Robert Zimmerman is on Fox.  I can't tell if he looks more like a mortician or the client.
@IngrahamAngle @prolifewill hahaha...like she was even in the running...smh
"@seanhannity @mollie_deckman Trump still at helm of his business, running a bare knuckle campaign, still made time for many interviews."
@seanhannity @daniels4_brian Sean you have the patience of a Saint in dealing with these comments.  Hang in there.
@peaceandjoy101 @blairanton @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump Perfect response from Mr (soon to be President) Trump
@CajunKangaroo go get em Mom!!!
"@MissLizzyNJ @CNNPolitics Ryan will soon endorse Trump...as well as many others.  Trump is a breath of fresh air...in a ""smoke filled room"""
"Add your own ""what are they thinking"" comments https://t.co/7Fz5TxDJnp"
"Hillary thinking ""wondering if he's still cheating""...Bill thinking ""wonder how she will look in a prison jumpsuit"" https://t.co/iuzOcccvdv"
@realDonaldTrump No need to announce VP running mate till after primaries.  TRUMP 2016!!!
@AngryAmerican97 But I wouldn't mind Cruz being nominated for SCOTUS
"@realDonaldTrump Mr Trump. I'm watching Hannity and your son is on right now.  Doing awesome, maybe slow down a bit on the words per second."
"Hillary has to be nervous.  If Trump appoints someone like Rudy as the Attorney General, she will fall faster than a turd from a tall moose."
@dhiggins63 thank you David....welcome aboard the Trump Train....very happy to have you Sir!

@oreillyfactor I hear the former president of Mexico will be asking Trump if he can hire on as the construction supervisor for the wall :)

@realDonaldTrump Mr Trump your B757-200 is awesome....but I think you're going to like the B747-200 just fine! https://t.co/zP9P4si2VI
@The_Trump_Train @Trump_Support Wonder what part of the house Monica lives in?
@MommaforFreedom How would you like to see that coming into the lady's room ..... just sayin
@TrumpNVIntern @Veteran4Trump @realDonaldTrump Welcome aboard Angelo!!  Happy to have you.
@Veteran4Trump @foxnewslatino I'm thinking Soros wears monogrammed depends.

"@greta @SenTedCruz Rude I'll accept.  However I didn't see police cars burning, bricks thrown, and bloodied faces Greta."
@blairanton @julieblue917 After Ted loses Indiana he will probably have Justice Roberts fly in to swear him in as president.
@realDonaldTrump @KarlRove I can't figure out which is larger....Rove's white board or his head.  I'm serious they're both YUGE!!!!
@tedcruz Senator Cruz. If you lose Indiana please consider dropping out of the race and backing Mr Trump. It's time! Thank you.
@moekamerow @prolifewill @realDonaldTrump @KarlRove exactly
@seanhannity @HeerJeet Hang in there Sean.  Wife and I love ur show.  She says you and I look like twins....ur just a younger version.
@seanhannity @wi_dale @FoxNews I am biased....I want TRUMP 2016!!!
@greta @joshtpm get a life josh
Ted picking a VP running mate would be like me picking one and I'm not even in the race...uh...wait a minute...neither is Ted..never mind.
@Veteran4Trump @los001979 The majority doesn't relate to thugs because we're not thugs.  The majority will rise and thugs will fall.  TRUMP!
@seanhannity @tedcruz @CarlyFiorina will have to pass Sean.
@LindaSuhler @julieblue917 @JaredWyand @club4growth And I'm sure all the grease didn't taste good either.
@LindaSuhler @julieblue917 @JaredWyand @club4growth Think he had a Cruz hair ball stuck in his throat.
"It's time for supporters of Cruz, Kasich, crossover Democrats, Independents, to rally behind Mr Trump to defeat Hillary....lets do it!!!!"
"@AdnHernndezG @jessebwatters some ""free"" advice Adan...go back down to mom's basement and give those man boobs a rest."
@whotheF_i_is They're for sure butt hurt.  I guess Trump could've been more presidential....and used lube. :)
@whotheF_i_is @jeffgully49 @Ramsteel007 Ever notice Ted keeps his hand in his pocket a lot?  Pocket pool? Something to hide?
@MissLizzyNJ @seanhannity Canada heard about this...they're now building a wall.
@YaBoyDeath @CajunKangaroo @realDonaldTrump or super pac contributor
@MissLizzyNJ AGREED!!
"@ArRuple @TerryMcAuliffe not to worry, most will be felons again before the election...just sayin"
@beth_wellington @seanhannity having to listen to Beck is probably more effective than water boarding.
@seanhannity @littlebob999 @BuzzFeedAndrew Mr Hannity has been extremely fair.
@seanhannity @littlebob999 @BuzzFeedAndrew time to go back down to mom's basement little bob.
#greta NO!
@Mediaite @AnnCoulter Beck has wandered too far off the reservation.  Can't listen to him anymore....and I don't.
@AnnCoulter @Loricatus_Lupus @thehill @mooshakins and I'm sure Cruz will have the same minority support as our current two term'r had...not
@BillKristol @AnnCoulter Bill probably thinks Carolina won the Super Bowl too.
@OwenHymn @AnnCoulter now that made me laugh :)
"@Johnnydontlike @realDonaldTrump I agree, will be much like the Dem debates.  Blah Blah Blah.  No reason to watch and I won't.  Trump 2016!!"
@NationofJake true that
@sarahhaleyTN @bellevuepastor TRUMP 2016!!!
@realDonaldTrump Mr Trump I heard Hillary was handing out free email addresses and unlimited data storage on her servers :)
@realDonaldTrump go Mr. Trump!!  Got my vote!!
@Duck_Commander support you Mr. Robertson...hope you and ur family have a Merry Christmas.
