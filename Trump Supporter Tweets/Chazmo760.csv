@shadowofthebat1 @shitlordarmy @seanhannity no our tax dollars shouldn't. But waterboarding isn't killing.
@shitlordarmy @shadowofthebat1 @seanhannity true but that wasn't the question. But ya.
@shadowofthebat1 @shitlordarmy cuz him and Bush should be tried for war crimes. But waterboarding isn't one of them.
@shadowofthebat1 @shitlordarmy torture is less than killing. Fact is you kidnap my child and you would be begging to be waterboarded
@shadowofthebat1 @shitlordarmy kill?  Um ask Obama
@shitlordarmy @LoordyMarie @seanhannity @LeftDial I would say liberal schools or no Daddy in their life. Or they were ignored as children.
@shadowofthebat1 @seanhannity @LeftDial we already jumped that shark with Obamas Drone killings.
