Can't wait for tomorrow when the media is over talking about Obama and his dumb event tonight. #alwaystrump We need @realDonaldTrump ❤️
Soooo @GovPenceIN basically gave @realDonaldTrump every compliment and then said I'm voting for Cruz. Smells like establishment bought!
Watching @realDonaldTrump in Costa Mesa! This rally is great! #Trump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #BuildThatWall #alwaystrump #MAGA
One of my favorite pastimes is commenting pro-@realDonaldTrump on any liberal media post. Damn those haters come out! Rawr! #Trump #MAGA
Losin lyin @tedcruz announced his limping mate @CarlyFiorina in Indiana where she was known to outsource jobs at HP. #Trump #IndianaPrimary

John Kasich didn't know what collusion meant and @CNN is having a field day with him! Great TV! @realDonaldTrump #Trump2016 #TrumpTrain
"@MarkSimoneNY @AnnCoulter 1 for 42 is the one I've heard. Before today it was ""that guy over there"""
I expected snake moves from @tedcruz not @JohnKasich has lost any credibility he had by what he's doing. #AlwaysTrump #maga
@AnnCoulter very good! And @JohnKasich looked like he was going to cry just now on @andersoncooper
@JohnKasich and @tedcruz you are both beyond ridiculous. Please go home. You're insane- @realDonaldTrump has gained even more support today!
@shapiro_stacy I took Motrin! I don't remember if I did anything else but I know that pain and it sucks 😓
@shapiro_stacy it was a couple days. I even went to the dentist Bc I was so scared!
@shapiro_stacy omg I did that once and it hurt sooooo bad!
@Ziplok_ 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Kasich is a liberal in conservative clothing @DiamondandSilk #partofcorruption
Has the #GOP had their come to Jesus moment that @realDonaldTrump is our nominee? #comeon #Trump2016 #TrumpTrain @DiamondandSilk
AMAZING NIGHT!!!! Thank you #NewYork 🇺🇸❤️👍🏻 @realDonaldTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #MAGA #TrumpTrain #nevercruz #AlwaysTrump
2 hours and 53 minutes until I am at home and watching all @CNN coverage on @realDonaldTrump winning YUGE in #NewYorkPrimary 🇺🇸❤️
@DiamondandSilk I did today! Great idea! ❤️ #VoteTrump #WomenForTrump #Trump #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump on @seanhannity is AMAZING!!!! The support ❤️❤️❤️❤️
@nbc finally saying if the #RNC denies @realDonaldTrump the nomination it will be the end of the #GOP I've been saying this for months!
@shapiro_stacy hilarious!!! 😂😂
@shapiro_stacy I love it too!!!!
@CNN #cnntownhall #TrumpFamily THE NEXT FIRST FAMILY! ❤️ #MAGA #Trump2016

Can Kasich just drop out now? April Fools is over. #trump #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@TiffanyATrump love how supportive you are of both of your parents! ❤️ @itsmarlamaples @realDonaldTrump
@shapiro_stacy IT WAS SO WEIRD!!!! I was speechless #ShamelessFinale
@shapiro_stacy omg the #ShamelessFinale 😳😳😳
@artvan #arfvan Gracie loves our new couch from you! https://t.co/8uWIEv0DIL
And no disrespect to the Wisconsin people! Last tweet meant for media only! Bashing #trump and making me angry!
I really hate that Wisconsin is being treated like they are the end all be all. Media covering only because that's it for April 5th #Trump
