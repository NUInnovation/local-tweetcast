Who are these voters who are polled for Fox? I've never been called. They must all be Ohio voters
The agenda is clear: deny Trump 1237, go to a brokered convention, and have the nomination decided by the Bush family. Time for a revolt
Gotta love the Fox News polls. Voters don't even know who Kasich is but they show him as a leader. They think we are so damned stupid
@LindaLeeJones11 @constitutionguy Other than their pro Kasich bs poll
I'm with America - not a political party... ANY political party. There's nothing admirable about supporting the sitting GOP.
Hillary would absolutely stomp on Kasich because DEMOCRATS would support her and never support Kasich or Cruz.
