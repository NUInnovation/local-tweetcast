@AveEuropa @Gavin_McInnes let's have a turtle sneak in the grenade in his shell
"@jpm05880 @ChrisKyle02 I've heard great things about A Latina, gonna have to go with her."
@Nero @ItsTheOoze @IHWCo I will throw you off a building Milo. And the whole world will see that you can fly.
@VivaLaAmes @ChrisKyle02 @TruthFeedNews I RTd but no reason to read. That face of hers is bad enough for me.
"@MDontheright @ChrisKyle02 @realDonaldTrump watch out, they might revoke your graduation for triggering!!!"
@MarkDice @Nero imagine the 3 weeks of news we'd hear if that was a KKK white guy talking about Obomba
@Nero @Cernovich I feel like you and Don are secretly the same person.
@Nero @Kwearo please be Don's vp
@Nero @AndrewKirell @greyhelm81 I'm more racist than anyone. üëçüèøüòéüëçüèø Albinos are the master race.
@Nero @jaketapper @SpeakerRyan @CNN @realDonaldTrump he's waiting for approval from the Mighty Jeb.
@Nero he also doesn't know how many Mexicans are in Mexico. No one does. Im gonna guess around 10.
@USAforTrump2016 wrong. Don is at 100%
@JohnKasich I beat Hillary 100-0. Beat that Johnny!!!
@PhiloFiles @petpanther0 @lindsay_putnam that's fake right?
"@insidehighered @petpanther0 most likely because they're racist, or don't like Hindus for some reason"
@MADE__USA @ChrisKyle02 @realDonaldTrump @gqforbes oh no. Kasich's at it again with shoving baskets of votes for himself into the machines.
"@JaredWyand @ChrisKyle02 hey, he needed to share that liver because diversity."
"@Lauren_Southern @petpanther0 next year it will be a gay, next a disabled person, then a tranny, then a cat, because its the 21st century."
@ImpeachObama10 @paul8248 @MichaelDelauzon oh no might as well call him kasich 2 now
@thehill @ChrisKyle02 they just wish they could stop his momentum. Kasich is going to go into that convention and show us al!!!!!!
@MichaelDelauzon @paul8248 don't worry. Lyin' Ted will be out of it tomorrow. Maybe
"@CAW622 @paul8248 @Jarboni72 I've been over this before, kasich has real momentum. Even more than our lord Jeb the Turtle. KASICH 2016!"
@ChrisKyle02 @JohnStossel @realDonaldTrump oh! Johnny should be at 100%. That's how many people have voted for him.
@JohnStossel @ChrisKyle02 @realDonaldTrump how does... What's his name? Even have 1 percent?
@RubinReport @Nero @TheStudyofEric @joerogan @enterrador_666 these people must be on the best weed on the planet.
@ChrisKyle02 @WomanPolls I genuinely forgot!
@ChrisKyle02 @WomanPolls oh kasich I forgot
"@LouDobbs @ChrisKyle02 @realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness I have a feeling that after the election, kasich will declare Ohio a sovereign state"
@4JStudios @eckoxsoldier @PopsRamjet I'll pay 20.00$ for a Destiny mash up or texture pack. Make it happen. Now.
@petpanther0 @MontagnaTony no it's worse. It's contagious
"@WomanPolls I identify as a woman today. If you say I'm not, you're a bigoted racist transphobic KKK fanatic."
"@WomanPolls @ChrisKyle02 hmmm isn't there a 5th guy? I keep forgetting his name.,."
"@DonaldJTrumpJr @ChrisKyle02 actually, they've always hated it. Islam is cancer."
@JohnKasich no. You're focused on your months long vacation and pancakes. No one believes you're running a campaign for anything.
@JohnKasich everyone knows you just want that money to buy more pancakes.
"@XboxSupport party hasn't worked for two days. Disconnects constantly, or won't even join"

@PrisonPlanet that thing looks like a trash can
@Nero yes. The terrorists would all kill themselves
@Nero TRIGGER DIGGER
@PaulaPaulacamp @ChrisKyle02 someone should add a picture of a kasich rally.....  I doubt he does then though.
@Nero I want that creature dead too
Hillary is the worst Raider ever. Barely even 300 Light.
Let's go on kasich's page and call him a lowser. #TowerParty

@PeteSeat no. Kasich
@sjptesta @JohnKasich @CapehartJ  I would rather give Obama a life term than vote for you
@indystartony @JohnKasich @PeteSeat how can you show your face in public?

"@2fast2igor @DefenderMikhail @Koxinga8 idk, not even sure why I typed glue."
@TrumpLion1776 @TeamJohnKasich @jpm05880 @ChrisKyle02 Obama could be giving him money to stay. His 0.1 % of votes throws off the other guys
