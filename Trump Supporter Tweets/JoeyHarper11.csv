@TuckerCarlson I agree the GOP is elite spitting in our eye. I am still a young man and I will never forget what they are doing.

@Jacki8182 @tedcruz Get back with me after @tedcruz is back at the Senate and @realDonaldTrump is bashing @HillaryClinton
"@Jacki8182 @tedcruz and for those who stayed home in 2012 instead of voting for Romney, well in my mind you're a Barry supporter"
@Jacki8182 @tedcruz Me and mine went for Romney because anything would have been better than Barry. Just dumb to say never Trump.
