@T64Pamela @CathyMAGA @FluffyDogAttack Night!
@T64Pamela @FluffyDogAttack @CathyMAGA Damn. I've never seen this fish before. I wanna go to the aquarium now. :(
@CathyMAGA @T64Pamela @FluffyDogAttack I used to when I first got my laptop because wasn't used to small screen and couldn't see my typos.
@T64Pamela @FluffyDogAttack @CathyMAGA Yeah.They send u head shots taken from above so their face looks tight and then opposite in person
@CathyMAGA @T64Pamela @FluffyDogAttack U already got me hooked. I subbed and will be watching on the TV. I'm a nerd like that.
@T64Pamela @FluffyDogAttack @CathyMAGA THAT'S RIGHT! I FOTGOT. OKAY?
@T64Pamela @FluffyDogAttack @CathyMAGA ...suspicious of anyone who acted like that. So many fake chick pics and you go to meet them and FAT
@T64Pamela @FluffyDogAttack @CathyMAGA She seemed like one. I'm still not sure if she is who she says she is though. AOL chatrooms made me..

@T64Pamela @FluffyDogAttack @CathyMAGA So ur talking to another BBer behind my back?!We were supposed to vacation 2gether in BreitbartLondon
@CathyMAGA @T64Pamela @FluffyDogAttack I've watched videos on YouTube of people buying new fish and they get so excited to add new fish
@T64Pamela @FluffyDogAttack @CathyMAGA You might have but I don't remember. Do tell!
@T64Pamela @FluffyDogAttack @CathyMAGA Then I have to spend half the day trying to figure out what they mean.
@T64Pamela @FluffyDogAttack @CathyMAGA At least it looks relaxing. My dreams are lucid and they get weird really fast.
@T64Pamela @FluffyDogAttack @CathyMAGA Now I see why your wallpaper is fish! It's all starting to make sense now. :D
@CathyMAGA @T64Pamela @FluffyDogAttack I want fish now. Damn you two!
@T64Pamela @FluffyDogAttack @CathyMAGA I've always wanted eels but I hear they are harder to keep than the fish.
@CathyMAGA @T64Pamela I betMy stepmom used to have a huge aquarium when she first met my Dad.I'd spend more time watching fish than with Dad
@T64Pamela @FluffyDogAttack @CathyMAGA Good lord. How long do they live?
@T64Pamela @FluffyDogAttack @CathyMAGA Damn. How much does it cost to start and keep one of those?
@CathyMAGA @T64Pamela That's beautiful. i bet it's better than watching TV.
@FluffyDogAttack @T64Pamela @CathyMAGA @alwaysssomethin  https://t.co/QOHAxzmKvp
@CathyMAGA @T64Pamela All that work pays off tho. I love going to the Aquarium in Golden Gate Park and Monterrey Bay. Jelly fish are awesome
@CathyMAGA @T64Pamela Get a BB gun. That's how my Dad used to control his outdoor pests. Was a good shot too.
@T64Pamela @CathyMAGA I should add that she decided she wanted fish. Got a small aquarium and the cat knocked it over and ate the fish. LOL
"@T64Pamela @CathyMAGA That's why I had to get rid of the snake and a few more other reptiles I had. Iguana, Bearded Dragons, Carpet Pythons"

@CathyMAGA @T64Pamela @alwaysssomethin @FluffyDogAttack The hum of the filter relaxes me for some reason too.
