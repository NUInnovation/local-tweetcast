@cnnbrk #BernieBrownShirts at it again I see
@FiliusLiberatus @DeepSouthProud and you want to talk comprehension?
@FiliusLiberatus @DeepSouthProud what dont you understand the basis of your argument is trumper...the rest is details..
@shookw @StevenKorbel @realDonaldTrump @LeahR77 im gullible? you havent said one thing on your own...all have been Cruz propaganda lines
@peterclik the irony..good try better luck next time
@shookw @StevenKorbel @realDonaldTrump @LeahR77 he gave cruz money...hes given more to reps.cruz co sponsored bills with schumer..try again
@shookw @StevenKorbel @realDonaldTrump said no to what? so what cruz says is the gospel and everythig trump.says is bogus.?
@shookw @StevenKorbel @realDonaldTrump @LeahR77 as oppsosed to cruz and his generalities...how is he going to accomomplish all his promises?
@shookw @StevenKorbel @realDonaldTrump @LeahR77 lol he hasnt released his tax plans?! they have been out.4 months.
@shookw @StevenKorbel @realDonaldTrump @LeahR77 unless you are a hedge fund manager your taxes arent going up...do some research
@shookw @StevenKorbel @realDonaldTrump where in there does it say he is going to raise taxes? by your logic i can say cruz is raising taxes
@shookw @StevenKorbel @realDonaldTrump @LeahR77 lmao way to regurgitate propaganda spewed by cruz...show me where he will raise taxes
@shookw @StevenKorbel @realDonaldTrump @LeahR77  by all means show me his tax plan that shows he is going 2 raise taxes on us.i'll b waiting
@shookw @StevenKorbel @realDonaldTrump @LeahR77 on the super wealthy..which is in his tax plan which also shows he lowers taxes for the rest
"@FiliusLiberatus @DeepSouthProud smh...were you or were not talking about ""Trumper"" who has nothing to offer but name calling.."
@FiliusLiberatus @DeepSouthProud no your basis was on Trumpers...the very premise your argument was towards...try again..
"@peterclik you literally just described cruz.  zealot blew that argument up against DT
heres a refresher on cult
https://t.co/T1cgQoUbee"
@FiliusLiberatus @DeepSouthProud so trumper isnt name calling?  Trumpers was the basis of your argument...whats it going to be?
@FiliusLiberatus @DeepSouthProud so trump is responsible now for Cruzs daughter hating him....or when cruz blamed trump for brussels...hmm
"@peterclik trump cult huh...cant think of https://t.co/DaXbFgSHcb you copy and put a https://t.co/NxumYUdIYY. ""yes we will"" a spin.of obama"
@DeepSouthProud @peterclik @mtff95 you are right...my bad
@FiliusLiberatus @DeepSouthProud its twitter...i see you have no argument so you resort to grammar...imagine that
@DeepSouthProud oh so a factual counter argument is now making excuses...my messiah? im not the one following a religious nut...
@peterclik @mtff95 @DeepSouthProud so anyone not in #cruzcult is a lib/dem? ..reagan must have missed the memo of a a con. only club
@DeepSouthProud palin is who got cruz elected.... bohner never endorsed dt...cruz was his lawyer though...graham bush right to rise....
@DeepSouthProud you cant choose who endorses you but you can choose who you stump with and people who introduce you
@mtff95 @DeepSouthProud umm...cruz is owned by them...find a better argument...
@DeepSouthProud he isnt running around with looney tune beck nor being introduced by a pastor who calls for the genocide of gays.
@FiliusLiberatus @DeepSouthProud sounds you are mistaken for Charlatan Cruz.
@DeepSouthProud no guilt here. just not a fan of charlatans using religion to veil their hunger for power
@DeepSouthProud yeah? kind of seems the other way around..you are supporting a dime a dozen politician and #Obama2.0 https://t.co/3eFKRNvQ2h
@DeepSouthProud enjoy #cruztown https://t.co/c6g5uHQx96
@DeepSouthProud why would you vote for  a lifelong politician? Cruz is a Bush...look at his associations. he is no outsider.
@DeepSouthProud the irony...cruz is OWNED by super pacs.....he cant wipe his ass now w/out permission
@DeepSouthProud yeah he is being honest about it. Trump isnt perfect but he is no Charlatan like Cruz
@DeepSouthProud are you ok with jim jones?
"@DeepSouthProud why did cruz give fiorina 500k? now shes his vp...hmm
what felony? pretty sure there would be charges.are you a lawyer now?"
"@DeepSouthProud probably alot.he's openly admitted he paid them in return for favord, thats why he isnt accepting money. what is your point?"
@BillKristol @USARebelSway that is fine...move then...i hear europe has become a lovely place to live....
@librtee2 @mlong42947 @BreitbartNews seems to be quite the pattern in the cruz campaign...
@jacobus4853 @SenTedCruz @Patrici15767099 you're right...he is too busy doing that for his puppet masters
@DeepSouthProud he donated to cruz soo....
@MJosephSheppard @cathymcmorris has my vote
@umpire43 @jkc_jaycee @WSJ usually they come.up the day after
@mitchellvii @YouTube her falling is foreshadowing the @tedcruz  campaign
@BreitbartNews the irony....
@Sousamagic @DrJerryFowler @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz yeah?  Reagan must have missed that memo...
@slappywhite2001 as opposed to what exactly? cruz whining about trump...spreading falsehoods...how is cruz going to do anything he says...?
@shookw @StevenKorbel @realDonaldTrump @LeahR77 pp is a dead cause..roe v wade is a dead cause...btw he is lowering taxes not raising.
@texas66 @LeahR77 @drewwyatt we are awake...we arent dems/repubs libs/cons we are Americans sick partisan politics
"@bakerlarry84 @DrJerryFowler @FoxNews you ""conservstives"" are the minority...btw its not the conservstives party."
"@Sousamagic @DrJerryFowler @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz didnt know it was the ""conservative""party."

@catalishus @UNDEADSLAUGHTER @22Americanfirst @KenDiesel @TXhighplains @ErinRehman thats fitting since cruz is #eliminaTED. DT WILL ge1237+
@UNDEADSLAUGHTER @AlanAshton10 @22Americanfirst @KenDiesel @TXhighplains whats that?
@UNDEADSLAUGHTER @AlanAshton10 @22Americanfirst @KenDiesel @TXhighplains yeah? cruz says something similar hmmm....

@honor_dennis @Billhic02785574 @JayS2629 it was released this morning dont be ignorant...
@greta he was an embarrassment? It was almost as bad as listening to Ted Cruz
"@arnion2 @WSJ @hookjan have you looked at Cruz's? it's just as bad but hes the one with ""real christian values"" right.  Cruz is a charlatan."
you always know when a primary is w/in 3 days ALL news sta. go anti trump &amp; TC supporters come out of hiding. Its been old and its pathetic
@arnion2 @WSJ @hookjan i already have decided..Cruz is a charlatan who uses religion to veil his hunger for power.
@arnion2 @WSJ @hookjan lmao they have...must have missed the months of all.out.assaults...there is nothing left. Cruz is the only real fraud
@Shekaymal @WSJ one non scientific poll has cruz up...its.a psyche poll...bogus
@jmartNYT @bhazpa lol cruz already spinning it to California now will decide his faith...
is Cruz for real right now? @jaketapper is a joke for letting him go on like this
@jaketapper what joke letting @tedcruz spew his absolute bullshit and not calling him on it.
@thepinkcrab @YungNamek @ShlomoHolowitz actually cults pertain to minority sects w/in a populatiom..pretty sure that encompasses #cruzcult
@ErinRehman @KenDiesel @TXhighplains @22Americanfirst uh huh...you can go sit on the bench with everyone else who has bee  wrong..enjoy :-)
@KenDiesel @ErinRehman @TXhighplains @22Americanfirst project much?
@KenDiesel @ErinRehman @TXhighplains @22Americanfirst he will get there june 7th...its over kid..cruz will drol out after his loss in Ind
@KenDiesel @ErinRehman @TXhighplains @22Americanfirst the irony..
@KenDiesel @ErinRehman @TXhighplains @22Americanfirst lmao yeah? so whats your next excuse after he secures 1237 and is the nominee
@ErinRehman @KenDiesel @TXhighplains @22Americanfirst your boy is out.of the race #cruzcult #eliminaTED https://t.co/NEJW50C5Ww
@ErinRehman @KenDiesel @TXhighplains @22Americanfirst https://t.co/4BANxhcbDz
@American1765 @YahooNews the logic of saying more people dont want DT so they give it to TC always blows my mind since more dont want TC
@TXhighplains @22Americanfirst @KenDiesel @ErinRehman cruz couldn't even get a majority in his own state...pretty sad really
@joy_of_soul @bhazpa do you even know what chapter 11 is? Do some Hw Before regurgitating propaganda...
@mitchellvii that poll that has tc up by 16% also gives zero information...its bogus
@mitchellvii that outlier poll.is nothing more than a psyche poll all other polls are consistent
@seanhannity @tedcruz well if that is the case that right there disqualifies him from nomination...Carly is probably the worst VP choice
