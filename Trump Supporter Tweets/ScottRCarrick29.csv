Cruz says Trump never changed. Does that mean he believes no one can change? Spitting in the face of born again Christians. @realDonaldTrump
@RandPaul Honestly I wish Michigan had a senator like you. Maybe I should run...  üòÅ
https://t.co/Xn9NW2D99z
Why does Cruz keep saying @realDonaldTrump is a liberal or HRC 2.0. I don't get. He spews lies. DJT will not take away 2nd amendment.
I wonder if Cruz will drop out when he loses tomorrow @realDonaldTrump #TrumpTrain. What about what's his face....... Oh yeah Kasich
George Will is off his rocker.   NeverTrump is so wrong.   @realDonaldTrump is a real leader and will us Great Again.   #Trumpgressions
Cruz has as many votes as people that show up to Trump events. Cruz can not win General @realDonaldTrump #trumptrain
Build the wall.
@realDonaldTrump #TrumpTrain. But accounting to Lyin' Ted he has beat you in ENORMOUS landslides. I don't think he knows what that means.
@realDonaldTrump Next lyin' Ted will name is cabinet.
@radiotalkermike @GretchenCarlson I can't tell. Is it a Trump.
@seanhannity @tedcruz @CarlyFiorina I have to watch paint dry. They are both too scripted. Besides I like job creators not destroyers
@seanhannity @tedcruz @CarlyFiorina sounds boring. If I wanted to be preached at I would go to bed. I can read from a script too
@radiotalkermike Great question.   It's looks creepily. Staged
@HughHewittShow wasn't Cruz hired by JohnB in 98 to be is attorney. That usually takes more than 50 words
@HughHewittShow how can you let Cruz just spew lies on your show. Disgusting. Neutral my ass.   Trump never said to disassemble NATO
@SenTedCruz. I wonder how you will win over my vote. I just see shady deals with you. It's sad I once held you in high regard. üòü
"@HughHewittShow. Wow!   Just wow.   What a puff piece.   Didn't hear one  ""real"" question this morning.  Your CRUZ stamp is showing"
I guess the women at @realDonaldTrump functions don't exists.
@realDonaldTrump are you surprised. Rumors that Kasich dropped out. I wonder who started that rumor?
Why doesn't @HughHewittShow interview some one like me. A red blooded American. An uneducated person because I support @realDonaldTrump
Fiorina and Cruz say the 10million plus votes doesn't matter. They spit on you and me. Call us uneducated. @realDonaldTrump #Trumptrain
Fiorina says Cruz can  beat Hilary. What a joke. Can't stant listening to @HughHewittShow anymore. #Trumptrain
@HughHewittShow. Don't say you are neutral when you only defend Cruz. If you support Cruz don't hide it. Used to like morning show. Byebye
@greta @babysgramma @realDonaldTrump did not change mine.   It was exactly how I feel. #Trumptrain #Trumpgressions.
@WilliamJBennett Tried by Fire.   Fantastic. Gave me a lot of ideas for the Book I have been writing. You get 1 of first copies
@realDonaldTrump the negative adds are just their way of showing panic. It saddens me really. This Mich. OEF vet is supporting you 100%
Lindsay Grahm is a joke. A worthless politician who couldn't even get 1 percent vote in his home state. @realDonaldTrump
@RandPaul I really hope you are in the next administration. We need more like you.
@seanhannity say hi to Belle.   She is a proper princess that doesn't like strangers around my wife or daughter. üòÅ https://t.co/CMHMWkiB8w
@GOP establishment would rather burn the country down. They do not want @realDonaldTrump it's sad really
@TedCruz the states you won were never a landslide. @realDonaldTrump his latest were landslides. #Trumptrain #Trumpgressions
Cruz &amp; Kasich are just burning money at this point.   You should give that to the #GOP
@TedCruz. Time for you to get on Trump Team before it's to late. @realDonaldTrump #GOP @GOP
Who is researching Trump supporters. They keep calling me uneducated. @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity #GOP @GOP.
Problem with Cruz and Kasich they dnt actually know the blue collar workers. @realDonaldTrump employs them he does know them.
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity establishment calls me dumb for supporting DJT they never called people dumb for voting in dems. Why??
Why I hate GOP establishment. They scold me call me uneducated. They call me stupid. Because I support @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity
Lyin Ted is at it again. Saying Trump is Hillary. Cruz is grasping now. It's sad. @realDonaldTrump #TrumpTrain #Trumpgressions
@FoxNews @RealBenCarson when it fits the narrative.  There is more about Benghazi we will never know major cover up. It's sad really
@seanhannity wow. just like the Elitist of the GOP. Running scared
Is Cruz team really handing out false delegate forms in Penn? @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity #Trumpgressions
Govt forgot it's by the people for the PEOPLE! The believe it's for govt. What happened to our liberty. @realDonaldTrump @RealBenCarson
@radiotalkermike @dcexaminer @eScarry Just shows how they don't really listen to the people. We the people.
Why is it if @realDonaldTrump Cruz believes HDR will win POTUS. And Senate will lose their to dems. Why does he believe this?
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @MarcoRubio maybe Marco and The Donald should team up. Just to stop these backroom crap from Cruz/Kasich
"What exactly is ""Presidential""? Is that bowing to the Saudis? Apologizing for WW2. No thank you. Give me Strength instead #TrumpTrain"
Never will I set foot in Target again #BoycottTarget
@seanhannity. Can Cruz run. I confused about the Canadian thing
Foreign leader do not have a say what we do here.   Stay our of our business @realDonaldTrump #GOP. Globalism is idiotic
@radiotalkermike @seanhannity @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump @GOP #GOP This sums it up. #TrumpTrain https://t.co/RnrWpjp0ih
If they give Nomination to Kasich I won't vote @realDonaldTrump @TedCruz. Establishment is a joke
@BreitbartNews. I guess Lincoln isn't good enough
@BreitbartNews no way.   Why did we live in the first place.
@RealJamesWoods. One of my favs. You are an excellent actor. And brave Hollywood common sense advocate
So you admit you were wrong. We never should of left. https://t.co/vhhL6wKyAL
@realDonaldTrump. I knew you were talking about Greenville Fire District. MSM is digging. Makes me sick. @seanhannity @GOP #Trumpgressions
@GOP @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump
With Iran backing Hezbollah by proxy are we backing Hezbollah. By giving money to Iran we are funding Hez. Isn't that Treason #GOP @GOP
Listening to Hugh hewitt. He makes sound like it's just fine and dandy to bribe delegates. That's the problem. @realDonaldTrump @GOP #GOP
@Cronikeys cracking me up
@realDonaldTrump I can't wait to see who's on your team. You only pick the best. #TrumpTrain
@seanhannity. Listening right now. You might be the only true neutral party. People claim to be but we know it's not true
1237. Watch the @GOP try to change that number.
Cruz wins home state by 17.1 Kasich wins home by 11.2 @realDonaldTrump wins by 35.3. Trump is strongest candidate. #TrumpTrain
Remember when @realDonaldTrump won some delegates in Texas. How many did Cruz win in New York? #TrumpTrain
@MBjorklund1963 @syoka68 @realDonaldTrump. That's just shows me that Bernie loves spending others money
@sarahzview  a trumpanzee. Hahaha. That's good Nope I'm a veteran for Trump Sorry I actually defended the constitution w/blood what about u?
@LGwalt ha. Why is that? Please tell me
@sarahzview @babysgramma @HouseCracka @LGwalt @AnnCoulter just hurt my brain a little
What the NY primary didn't show was the amount of dems that will vote for @realDonaldTrump #TrumpTrain #Trumpgressions
@seanhannity how dare you sir. Fighting for answers. Did you not get the memo. You are nt supposed to challenge estab ideals. No vote Wins
Carson got more votes than Cruz is some districts.   @realDonaldTrump #Trumpgressions #GOP @GOP
@BillKristol @Ma1973sk ha. How. This guy is a genius.............
Cruz supporters are complaining about how many delegates NY has. But loves voterless wins. Cruz campaign is a joke #letthepeoplevote
@seanhannity you did good yesterday and last night. You just want answers. Cruz answered like an est. Crony. Memorized responses. Not real
Election system outdated and unfair.   Why vote if delegates do not support the will of the people. @TedCruz @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump
@HughHewittShow Never Trump on your show today.   Feels like I am listening to NPR. Disappointing
@TedCruz won wisconsin because ALL media was in his pocket. Cruz can not win General.   Will get crushed by HRC.
@TedCruz can not win the south. Will get crushed by Hilary. #TrumpTrain
Who paid off Walkers campaign debt? Can some one say bribe? #corrupt #letthepeoplevote
Cruz stood up to DC? Only when it didn't matter. Caved when it counted! @GOP #GOP @realDonaldTrump.
@realDonaldTrump knew the rules. He just refuses to bribe people. He has integrity unlike @TedCruz. #TrumpTrain. #Letthepeoplevote
@realDonaldTrump crushes Hilary the in general elections. #TrumpTrain
@Cronikeys yes they matter a lot more than millions of people wanting to destroy the USA
@realDonaldTrump #TrumpTrain. How is Cruz going to spin tonight. He will tell supporters it was a victory to him. Cruz saddens me
@seanhannity sorry Mr. H. These people are trolls. Or not listening to you. You just want to know what to tell your audience.
@seanhannity is there a way to listen to your broadcast again?   Would like to hear whole interview and let wife listen.   Thank you
@seanhannity no worries Mr. Hannity. You were in right only people that are mad are the 1s that know he is in the wrong
@seanhannity I only listened to a few minutes U were fair. Cruz wasn't he kept dodging question about delegates. Good work Mr. Hannity
Why would @realDonaldTrump be a disaster.   Because he will break up the welfare state of DC. Hold them accountable! I wnt my country back!
@radiotalkermike people hate the west due to Envy.
@TedCruz is Bribery playing by the rules. Can you say your crew has not bribed in order to get votes @realDonaldTrump @GOP @seanhannity
I voted for @realDonaldTrump before it was cool. #GOP #TrumpTrain been on your side since beginning. #puremichigan
How can the people who swore to protect the constitution vote for Bern or Hilary @realDonaldTrump #GOP @seanhannity @radiotalkermike
@seanhannity @TedCruz. Cruz calls DJT a loser. He also calls me uneducated. Not only does he insult DJT he insults voters.
@TedCruz @GOP. Why is @realDonaldTrump a loser?
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity. DJT has to win on first ballot. I believe delegates will jump ship to Cruz and Kasich. Voters dnt matter
@HughHewitt. @realDonaldTrump says he hopes there is no violence. But Hugh thinks he means he is calling for violence? In Clvlnd #TrumpTrain
@realDonaldTrump if NY was open primary you would get 70 percent. #TrumpTrain
If GOP loses election. I am moving to New Zealand #TrumpTrain @realDonaldTrump #GOP @GOP @seanhannity @radiotalkermike
@radiotalkermike if @realDonaldTrump is nominee he will pick her apart. Every atk she uses will come bk on her. She has nothing #TrumpTrain
@HispanicsTrump @babysgramma @NCState #Trumpgressions
