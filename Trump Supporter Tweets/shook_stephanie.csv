@Kerri1111 @POLITICAL_Jeff They're seriously pissed because they have alot of $ on the table. Too bad Time to end this charade

@MyPresidentme @ChargerGreg @Po_st He's doing it too
@jamesspivey @FoxNewsSunday @KimStrassel @realDonaldTrump I believe he'll go in with the 1237 or more and it won't be an issue
@gerfingerpoken2 @mglessman He thinks the techy aspect of it will sell to his base
@I_AmAmerica @blupony3 What a sweetie you are!
@Daggy1 Because they don't know what it really is. They'd be the first to go and they don't see that. Socially maladjusted.
@asamjulian @annieb0823 Yes he does.
@_HankRearden Boo hoo I'm so sorry for them.
@gretstan @Charlie4Trump I agree. I think he has more all across the board period.  Reality messes up Rove's little data charade.  LOL
@NahBabyNah @townhallcom Wonder why. Bet we can guess where that $ has gone
@Trumptbird @realDonaldTrump Sweet!

@LindaSuhler @FrenchForTrump @BreitbartNews He can't be that stupid can he?
"@swebs Yup Lyin' Ted was out there touting ""he's gonna take your 2A rights away from you"".  He knew that would scare his base. Lying jerk"

@russmove @magnifier661 Exactly.  Says we don't work. WTF does he think bankrolls his country's economy?  The tooth fairy?
@MADE__USA @teamtrump402 @realDonaldTrump Very cool
@247razz @Elverojaguar I love those little horses They are so sweet
@trumpology @garydailydrift @syoka68 I live in car town Los Angeles and i have only seen maybe 4 HRC bumperstickers in 6 mos.
@The_Trump_Train Probably boring redundant speeches.  They got ripped off if they thought she would have a substance Must have been 4 favors

@MiskaPhillip @UnPoliticalPrty @WRogersM @TruthFeedNews That is disgusting
@rtoberl  I do not like him. He is a lying dirtbag
@AgendaOfEvil @ozarkrambler So sick and so sad
@Cronikeys Really weird in L.A. I have seen very few Hillary bumperstickers &amp; a handful 4 Bernie. By this time the libs usually out in force
@sunny_rub30 @dawngpsalm63 Yes

@tracieeeeee @Flying59Vette @im2byteme @Campaign_Trump @BringtheFlag LOL HW You go girl. This campaign season going to be FUN!

@tomborelli @Callisto1947 @deneenborelli Words of wisdom from the peanut gallery.
@elohimis1 Best free campaign ad @realDonaldTrump  could ask for
@realDonaldTrump @jackson3pack We'll do it with or without him. His choice.
@littletboca @Amberis4LSU Yup.  Mitt went full blown brat on the USA
@Nazretsel @dawngpsalm63 @LindaSuhler @realDonaldTrump All they're doing is demonstrating what liars they truly are. HACKS
@Conservative_VW Because they thought they'd be supporting themselves.   SURPRISE SURPRISE SURPRISE LMAO https://t.co/q7XU5HtWIO
@Firebase301 @risetoflyy Yup. Trump disrupted their little plans and designs. Tee hee
@SandraR14676287 @TruckerBobS @FoxNews  He'll pick the right one regardless.
@AndrewArlink @rockynickydog @22Americanfirst @GunnetteP @RealRudyGiulian  Rudy a real leader too
@cmahar3 @dcexaminer Fox a serioys POS . We crazy drunks have taken a vote and no more bankrolling your failing country Putzman
@BocaRatonRC @realDonaldTrump  needs to another 20 feet. Fox is you're classic tin horn schlep.
