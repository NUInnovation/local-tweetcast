"Ppl ask me why I don't support #Cruz when I'm from TX &amp; UT Longhorn, they don't get #Trump is only one to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #tcot"
This is why #Trump as a candidate makes sense. #Cruz is one of the problems https://t.co/6mKLIFezVN
"#Veterans, don't forget #Benghazi &amp; make sure #CrookedHillary doesn't get voted in, be a true #American !! #Trump #Trump2016 #CruzCrew #Cruz"
"#CruzCrew #Cruz supporters who are anti-#Trump, DON'T FORGET #Benghazi !!!!! #Trump2016 #tcot #WakeUpAmerica"
#CruzCrew #Cruz supporters who are anti-#Trump forget about #Benghazi &amp; just want a murderer like @HillaryClinton to be Pres. #Ashamed
@cmdorsey @mooretommyh @p8triat Goodluck with ur pipedream while you'll still have 2 live in USA with 1 of the other candidates as Prez
"@cmdorsey @mooretommyh @p8triat Ted isn't an actual candidate anymore &amp; takes away from #Trump, so it is a vote for Hillary. #Trump2016"
@HillaryClinton is a TOOL for Wall Street. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump #Trump2016
"Ignore the anti-Trump groups, which are supported by the left, as they will go into irrelevance, instead #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, vote #Trump"
The only way to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain is to support #Trump &amp; not to support candidates already dropped out &amp; divide US! #Trump2016
#Cruz has lied &amp; is still deceiving Americans by getting them to not support #Trump &amp; not vote. Anti-American reeks of insider politics!!
"Those in the GOP in opposition to #Trump, are in opposition to unity &amp; represent divisiveness &amp; what is wrong in America. #Trump2016"
#Trump will make America great again but the true believers must stay the course &amp; not be dissuaded by the left &amp; the un-American #Trump2016
#NeverTrump &amp; #CruzCrew is a ponzi scheme perpetuated by the left &amp; those looking to tear America down #WakeUpAmerica #Trump
#NeverTrump is a huge effort by the left and un-American thinkers to supplant unity in the GOP with hatred #WakeUpAmerica #Trump
The paranoia &amp; false amoral narrative of the left &amp; #NeverTrump has deceived ppl in the GOP to act against each other #WakeUpAmerica #Trump
"#Trump represents the good of what America is all about, the ability of an outsider to make a change &amp; step up in a needed time #Trump2016"
What's wrong in this country is the divisiveness of Libs &amp; anti-Trump ppl. We need to come together as one. #Trump2016 #Trump
We've lost something in this election &amp; I realize that this #NeverTrump movement is ruining this country &amp; what used to be American #Trump
To all you idiots in the #NeverTrump movement: https://t.co/Qd6YyssDwG - I'm sure you'll support ur spineless leader Hillarious. #Trump2016
"failed prez nobama &amp; @HillaryClinton, are in desperation mode to try &amp; stop the momentum of @realDonaldTrump. #Trump2016 #Trump"
"@HillaryClinton is scared shitless about @realDonaldTrump, he is going to wipe the floor with her! #Trump #Trump2016"
Damn straight!! https://t.co/u4tw6M2dhe
Dems are definitely more scared of @realDonaldTrump then any other GOP Nominee https://t.co/oXs2WkiDPP
