@shawn_larkin @ProgressOutlook Their 'constitution consavative' ted stooge also voted to increase immigration. https://t.co/NcVXdzMYJD
@Cool_C_Mo @politico Perhaps. I wouldn't give a dime about those buzzwords. If the truth is offensive so be it. https://t.co/Pt0hB5ujce
@shawn_larkin @ProgressOutlook nobody cares about those phony polls anymore. According to them low energy Jeb! would have been the nominee
@Moralespj yes! https://t.co/ttLxmhPQAK
@Moralespj okay https://t.co/uwMCQ97PnN
@ProgressOutlook Totally. Ted Cruz knows exactly how to win over undecided voters. This is why he got beat badly among Republican voters.
"@SSSingh00 well also because of shit ton of niggers tho, honestly"
"@ProgressOutlook Outside his core electoral base where he got crushed, no one would vote for a bible thumping extremist loon. You are stupid"
@ProgressOutlook so a delusional chump like you thinks ted cruz who got crushed by his core electoral base will get more crossover votes.
"@ProgressOutlook Did you look at the primary results ? If people hate Trump, why didn't they vote for liar Cruz ? You are a delusional idiot"
Ron Paul Intellectually Pummels goofy @elizabethforma https://t.co/kluBsmVkE5 via @YouTube
@ProgressOutlook oh wow a phony online poll! We take all the primary polls in which cruz got his weasel ass handed to him.
