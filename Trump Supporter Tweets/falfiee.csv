Truth is @realDonaldTrump is more conservative than the @GOP #AmericaFirst #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #BuildThatWall  https://t.co/9EgZTkxKyC
@realDonaldTrump had me with #AmericaFirst #trumpstory
"@CyndiRocks1 @_HankRearden Ok, just caught me off guard"
@chucktodd Why don't you challenge #Hillary instead of giving her your softball questions in advance? Do you get money for promoting her?
@jamss3468 @LindseyGrahamSC Hope he's ready for retirement in 2020
"@TheTruth24US @Info24US Still gun control, just like they went from global warming to climate change."
@_HankRearden Excuse me?
@Reince your boy @SpeakerRyan tried to PUBLICLY shake down @realDonaldTrump &amp; circumvent MILLIONS of #Trump #Voters We need a PUBLIC APOLOGY
@FaceTheNation do you deny giving #Hillary advance copy of your softball questions?
@DanScavino @TrumpFL @JebBush @GMA @GStephanopoulos @realDonaldTrump Yhat was when he was sure the @GOP Est would pull it out for him #MAGA
@JeffFlake millions &amp; millions have voted for @realDonaldTrump because of his positions. #LeadFollowOrGetTheHellOutIfTheWay #Trump2016
"@meetthepress how many candidates have had over 60,000 ads run against them by their own party? But @realDonaldTrump has to unify? #DumpRyan"
@meetthepress All you got from O was hope &amp; change &amp; you cheered promoted  &amp; asked him about favorite hot dogs #hypocracy
@meetthepress How about an honest in depth interview of @HillaryClinton without feeding her questions ahead? #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst #MAGA
@JudgeJeanine All @SpeakerRyan had to do was not seek out an interview to try to extort @realDonaldTrump into breaking promises to voters
@tluvgolf @MooiachiRios @MARVINBURKY No problem. I knew you misunderstood
"@Montel_Williams Read this word for word, Trump wasn't mentioned anywhere."
"@tluvgolf @MooiachiRios @MARVINBURKY Not correct, this was a man Hillary got off but it was not Bill. I hate Hillary &amp;Bill but this not true"
"@FoxNews @scout1881 @ericbolling No, #WeThePeople saw our party was taken over by #LiberalsInRhinoClothing and WE did a #HostileTakeBack"
