Funny how people still think Trump doesn't have a chance in the General Election. Can't wait to see the look on their faces when he does win
@_Makada_ I like to workout too. Mostly weightlifting and bodybuilding stuff.
@_Makada_ You're beautiful and you look great in that hat! &lt;3
@Lrihendry You're a gorgeous lady for sure. Yes please. &lt;3
If you hate Donald Trump then it's proof you don't understand politics and government at all. They just go by what the media says. Pathetic.

@Cronikeys Trump is able to handle his protesters just fine like a man but Hillary can't handle them at all. She is weak.
"Listening to Tom Petty's ""Full Moon Fever"" album. I've always loved this album! \m/"
Who cares about this Blac Chyna. Why is the media always in bed with trashy and slutty female celebs? It's why I don't read gossip sites.
People with far-left political views continue to suck and they’re getting worse too… https://t.co/ILMpTHKzvY
@Rockprincess818 Her naked body is so disgusting who'd want to sleep with that? Lena wanted attention and she got it. Blech....
"True, sad thing is that Trump haters would never admit that taking out 16 other candidates was impressive #Trump2016 https://t.co/PexFvTQR6J"
"Dear liberals, when will you ever learn that not everyone sees the world the same way you do. Think about why we're all supporting Trump."
"@mitchellvii Jeff Sessions, all the way."
"Interesting how some still believe illegal aliens don't rape women, murder people and bring in drugs. They really believe they're harmless?"
@OldGloryHole That game looks cool. I really need to get a PS4 to get catch up with the new games 'cause I don't have one yet. Have Ps3.
Isis is tough to fight 'cause Isis isn't even real. All those videos they did were a film production. https://t.co/VZE671frrs
Liberals really are mentally ill. They all claim that America is already great but they go to Bernie for help on the economy and free shit.
Trump haters go nuts over Elizabeth Warren 'cause they'll love anybody that hates on Trump. Warren another idiot desperate for attention.
We need to find a way to get Hillary and Bernie both to dropout so Trump can become the presumptive president. That could happen too!
@HouseCracka Watch Glenn Beck do the same thing. It's coming.
I think people on the far-left are getting angry 'cause they realize they are getting defeated and they don't like it. Tough shit!
@IvankaTrump You're definitely a pretty lady for sure. You ready to become the first family? :)
I respect Donald Trump a lot more now… what he did in this election was incredible… https://t.co/C8tiqu60VQ
16 other GOP candidates are done and now we have to find a way to get Hillary &amp; Bernie to step down.
"Gotta love how people think illegal aliens aren't criminals. That's what they all are. If they're undocumented, that's illegal."
It'll help to get into intelligent debates with liberals if they would stop having one-sided opinions all the time. That's why we're fed up.
"Liberals are imploding. Getting mad as hell. Get used to it, Trump is the next one!"
There are some Trump haters who actually believe Hillary is gonna beat him in the General election. Funny shit.
I love watching the Trump haters implode due to Trump's primary election victory. It's entertaining as hell.
Will Kasich end up endorsing Trump so we can unify? That could be what's coming also. Just a thought.
Kasich said he's not dropping out so I don't know what his announcement later this afternoon will be. Maybe Cruz will be his VP running mate
Looks like Kasich is still going. Will we be successful at taking this asshole down?  https://t.co/5wDVcmBFYD

@SeanAstin Used to be a fan of your movies but not anymore since you're a blind Hillary supporter. Unfollowing.
"All those so-called ""independent"" voters still have a lot of liberal views so therefor they aren't ""independent"". They're closeted liberals."
"Ted Cruz is making me despise the man, more and more. Can you imagine Ted as president? He'll be worse than Bush &amp; Obama for sure."
"Listening to some more @tompetty albums this morning. Listening to his album, ""Long After Dark""."
@OldGloryHole He's not doing anything in his career. Got fired from WWE and he's probably broke. Low on money so Gawker is his target.
"The New Day is one of the worst tag teams I've ever seen but I love the Vaudevillains, though!"
@WayneDupreeShow @thecjpearson I stopped supporting this kid after he endorsed Bernie Sanders. Fraud. Don't trust him.
@Rockprincess818 Isn't it funny that Ted still claims that NY Times has a tape of Trump saying those things about the wall? Prove it Ted!

"If you support illegal aliens, Muslims, gun control, hate the police, etc. It's obvious you hate America and you will never admit it."
I love destroying Bernie fans and I win every time too. If you're a Bernie supporter and wanna debate me. Watch out. I'll destroy you.
Even Bernie Sanders himself doesn't hate Hillary. Bernie always said he respects Hillary but his supporters claims to hate her. So wrong.
So true. The truth is a lot of Bernie fans hate Trump but they are all secret Hillary supporters.  https://t.co/ChvVRTzdvQ
"WWE Network is surprisingly great, it’s a keeper!!! https://t.co/1PSvKHyyG1"

"@EBischoff Tonight's Payback ppv really reminded me of you controlling RAW back in the day. We really need you back, Eric. Hopefully soon!"
Watching WWE Payback now... the kick off show that is.
"Now that I'm a WWE Network subscriber, I'm probably gonna watch ""WWE Payback"" tonight. Nothing else better to do."
"There's a reason I don't support Bernie, Hillary, Ted and John 'cause they're all career politicians. Politicians aren't to be trusted."
I support Trump for many reasons but the main reason is that I'm done supporting career politicians. Time to get rid of 'em. Get 'em out.
If you support Bernie Sanders then it's clear you don't know what's really going on in America. You're just being brainwashed by Bernie.
I already did a video on illegal aliens. My next videoblog will be about how our veterans aren't being cared for in the US. Stay tuned...
It's incredible how Bernie fans don't believe that illegal aliens commit crime &amp; don't believe our veterans aren't being cared for. Fuck 'em
"Aaaaawww, look at all these poor little liberals getting mad 'cause I attack the Obama family. Boo hoo... crybabies..."
Who cares what college Malia Obama goes to. Why does every little thing about Obama family have to be huge news? Who cares...
Trump is about to get to the 1237 but Cruz and Kasich still in. WTF?  https://t.co/y4SyQEbL9y
