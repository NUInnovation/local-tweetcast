"@pmv1 @WilkowMajority @heyrendelectric Absolutely NOT true. The top 1% not only create jobs, but also pay the lions-share of taxes"
"@pmv1 @WilkowMajority @heyrendelectric We need a whole lot less of it, yes!"
@WilkowMajority  But I wouldn't expect you @pmv1 to understand or follow it as a socialist... Communist Manifesto more up your alley
@WilkowMajority @pmv1 The Constitution is a timeless document. The first of its kind... Limited federal control to allow individual liberty
@pmv1 @WilkowMajority @heyrendelectric Praised by idiots. Those that have an agenda and totally do not adhere to The Constitution
@WilkowMajority @pmv1 @heyrendelectric absolutely. The new deal was the beginning of multigenerational gov't dependency that continues...
@JohnnyFlynn33 @SteveRattner @meetthepress Saw the interview... HE said it... Very disappointed
@pmv1 @WilkowMajority @heyrendelectric Private sector is much more efficient with capital
@pmv1 @WilkowMajority @heyrendelectric Allow individuals and businesses to spend or invest how they see fit. Gov't does not create jobs!
@pmv1 @WilkowMajority @heyrendelectric FDR was a Marxist. Started the decline of US that hasn't stopped... New Deal... BAD!
"@pmv1 @WilkowMajority @heyrendelectric Yes. Unconstitutional... Not an enumerated power of any of the three branches. Read it, live it!"
"@BreitbartNews @realDonaldTrump Mr. Trump, with all due respect, raising taxes on anyone with this economy is the wrong idea. #overtaxed"
@RJFucci @sjhh @Cyclevangelist I agree that is racist... Trump did not post it
@sjhh @RJFucci @Cyclevangelist That's not helpful at all... Reagan should not be defamed in that manner! I'm not and he wasn't a racist
"@RJFucci @rockoz71 @Cyclevangelist Much more fixable with a broken up R party or viable 3rd party... Hillary wins, we lose with same shit"
@RJFucci @rockoz71 @Cyclevangelist Trump is the closest to 3rd party with realistic shot... You want things to change? Break up the cartel
@RJFucci @rockoz71 @Cyclevangelist No candidates that have a prayer. I reluctantly supported Rs before. DT is no different imo
@RJFucci @rockoz71 @Cyclevangelist Because #NeverHillary !!!!!
"@rockoz71 @RJFucci @Cyclevangelist That's ok, I can take it. It's all they have. Lies and name calling. I was a Cruz guy, but #NeverHillary"
"@Cyclevangelist I got that. You and I are on the same page. Bomb throwing, name calling, open borders guy is the problem"
"@Cyclevangelist my negative tweets are directed at the open borders, @RJFucci"
@RJFucci @Cyclevangelist This is where we fundamentally disagree... Citizens and those who come here legally! We cannot accept everyone!
@RJFucci @Cyclevangelist America is NOT home for everyone! It is home for citizens and those the immigrate LEGALLY!
"@RJFucci @Cyclevangelist Please enlighten me... Is he PC? I concede, no. Bigoted? Haven't seen or heard it..."
@RJFucci @Cyclevangelist Where in the hell are you getting that garbage? He will do more good for minorities than BHO has...
"@RJFucci @Cyclevangelist IF HRC wins, we all will be... Categorical disaster and likely the end of America as a global leader."
@RJFucci @Cyclevangelist Ok.👍🏻 the dumbasses were last election... Re-electing an utter failure has brought us to this point
@RJFucci @Cyclevangelist At least we agree on that
@RJFucci @Cyclevangelist I watch and listen all the time. Nothing bigoted yet...
@RJFucci @Cyclevangelist what bigotry? Hillary is the bigot. She denies minorities opportunities. Keeps them right where she wants them
"@IngrahamAngle  But if he raises my taxes, I will withdraw my support"
"@IngrahamAngle @ByronYork WTF??!! Shameful. Support the nominee!Just like we were told with Dole, GWB, McCain, Romney. Just as liberal as DT"
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump I was hoping you meant as. Potential VP...
"@Sandman7773 @UltimateLions that's good cuz that killed us last year with Tully and Van Noy in coverage, Chargers game in particular"
What??? @JohnnyFlynn33  https://t.co/cQ3NaqZrot
@scrowder Saddest part of that whole scene is how that able bodied young man is given food stamps in the first place. Get a damn job!
@LPDonovan but I truly believe that Paul Ryan will lose his primary if he does not support Donald Trump
@_Makada_ Please convince your friends to do the same!! #NeverHillary
"@estate_fifth ok. Good luck with HRC. I will suck it up and vote R, just like I did for Romney, McCain, and GWB. Can't see DT as different"
"@LPDonovan we will see. Hopefully DT grows up a bit, picks a great VP, and reassures Rs who didn't vote for him. Far better than alternative"
@estate_fifth @FoxNewsSunday @brithume @realDonaldTrump Your hashtag is a joke... One of them will be president. We know what HRC is...
"@LPDonovan I think he's more likely to lose his job this way, I guess that's my point. His right to take the risk, but I think he's wrong."
@LPDonovan And I believe it was his right to do so... I think there's nothing wrong with waiting to see what DT does from here. Just a risk
"@LPDonovan OK, still don't know why that matters. DT got smoked in WI, but so what? Still think Ryan took a big risk..."
"@LPDonovan @HotlineJosh @jaketapper Don't really understand your point, I guess... Is it that Ryan is ""safe"" because WI1 went against DT?"
@pigpen813 @JustWinDetroit @NYRBII @USL out of the sport! It is a privilege to get paid to play a sport He just forfeited that privilege IMO
@LPDonovan @HotlineJosh @jaketapper So... It's not like Ryan was a Cruz guy either
"What say you, @seanhannity ?  Personally I think you have been more than fair to all candidates!  https://t.co/uYyzKdOkDn"
"@HotlineJosh @jaketapper @CNNSotu Don't agree with Ryan, but please go away, @SarahPalinUSA YOU'RE NOT HELPING!"
@nc4everblessed @Csinaco @RednaxalA @drmom47 @ClubSpeaks Ok. He lost. Time to unify.
@LBC @KTHopkins Rules are different because of biology...
@DrKellyVictory @costareports AND... ANY... SENSE... OF... CREDIBILITY!!
@BasedUbaIdo @MotorCityGoBlue Lions will be 1 or 2 in offense
@DineshDSouza @BillKristol @costareports Bill Kristol is an ass! Time to go away.
@MotorCityGoBlue I hate the Vikings!!
@seanspicer @newtgingrich @GOP @Reince good gracious. It's 22 pages... Summary?
@Sandman7773 @TheLionsMan Is Levy really going to be back this season?... Hard for me to hope
@Ameerguapo German Shepard. Smart as shit...
@Ameerguapo Dog for sure
@G855D @ImSeanO 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
@WilkowMajority @RichTweets @cmb88fan That's racist...😂😂😂
@RichardWeaving @Csinaco Sweet! Like it.
@Csinaco thx for the follow...
@RichTweets @WilkowMajority Douche
@DrKellyVictory @farhip They have to lie... Americans will not accept the truth. They would be out on their ears...
@AllenWest Shame on them. I was a Cruz supporter... I will now full-throatedly support @realDonaldTrump. The alternative is unthinkable...
"@JamesRCollette @WilkowMajority @elizabethforma Hillary responsible for American deaths, responsible for national security nonchalance..."
@OLineWorld65 How young is too young to work with you?
@Justin_Rogers Smart decision...
@shadihamid @HotlineJosh What suspicions? That Obama lied... Whew what an epiphany!! Does he ever tell the truth? Ever?!
"Trump's Policy Plans Are Real, Detailed--and Great @mgdmd1  https://t.co/YojXyicJmV"

"@BenSasse @HotlineJosh Knock it off, Sasse..."
@RealJamesWoods @GStephanopoulos So true. Another Clinton suck up! Weasel!...
@JustWinDetroit agreed
@ReaganCoalition Take toys and go home. Unfortunately we will see that a lot this year
@davebirkett @freep Finally people will see he's deserving... He will rise to the occasion
"@paulapasche Thanks, Paula! Sad. Thoughts and prayers!"
It's Trump. Get Over It.@mgdmd1  https://t.co/3WkZEYwTuC
"@ReaganWorld @HotlineJosh @seanhannity Please don't ""take your toys and go home"" the republic depends on us to help him!"
"@ReaganWorld @HotlineJosh @Reince Michael, perhaps sticking around would help steer Trump in a positive direction @seanhannity (1/2)"
@paulapasche @tomlewand what happened??!!
@TwitchyTeam voters don't care... They heard it from their own mouths during the campaign... Trump still won!
@MrEasyStreet @George_Kostakos 👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻😂😂😂 70? Ignorant? Good luck in life. Go Lions!
@MrEasyStreet @George_Kostakos 👍🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻
@MrEasyStreet @George_Kostakos He has actually succeeded as an executive. Hillary's accomplishments? Founders never intended career pols
@George_Kostakos @realDonaldTrump I left the other 2 out of it. You seem reasonable
@George_Kostakos Why screwed with @realDonaldTrump? Loves America! Has good positions. Let's see how it goes. #NeverHillary
"Ok, @MrEasyStreet 👍🏻😂"
@MrEasyStreet @Ebron85 much
@Ebron85 Give me a break!
@Ebron85 Better than the alternative... #NeverHillary
@davidfrum @HotlineJosh @TheAtlantic Uh no... She's a criminal crony capitalist.
@WilkowMajority What??!!
@AllenWest Shame on him...
@EdMorrissey @thehill Kasich or Newt. That's who I'd pick
@RedState Unfollow... And I voted for Cruz
@_bigplayslay23 @JennWilliams23 You guys are cute
"@KatTimpf @barstoolsports That's hilarious! Scary, but hilarious!!"
"@JaySekulow I feel that way, but I would rather the dumbasses stay home tbh"
@Big_Tah47 @Riddick6 Yes. Happy bday. Contract extension for your present??!!
@JaySekulow Kasich VP. Carson HHS secretary. Christie A.G. Cruz 1st SCOTUS nominee...
@JaySekulow Kasich #JayLive
@AllenWest We cannot sit this out. Need to unify behind Trump. The time is now.
"@davidfrum @HotlineJosh @DouthatNYT you may be right, but it may just be defeat of a whiny, condescending candidate. Btw, I voted for Cruz"
"@realDonaldTrump Good luck! You have my support, but please work hard to unify us all against her... #neverhillary"
"@AnnCoulter Really think he can win? I hope you're right, but I worry about a Clinton presidency... #neverhillary"
@dgjackson @HotlineJosh @Reince @realDonaldTrump @GOP Then you elect an even more dangerous phony... Take your toys and go home
@KTHopkins @realDonaldTrump Didn't know you were a fan of his... Glad to hear it. Time for American Republicans to unite. #NeverHillary
@Cville2Cville @JonathanHoenig Sure it is. The argument for embracing Trump and helping shape his platform. We need to unite!
@JonathanHoenig You were serious... Unfollow
@McCormickProf @brithume At least the latter is proven false (although I believe neither is accurate)
"@steveschale @HotlineJosh Didn't say I thought it would happen, I just think it's more likely than a blue landslide... Have a good night"
"@steveschale @HotlineJosh might still be a landslide, but in the opposite way you think..."
@ChopReid k. Would've been surprised. Have a great season! Go Lions!!
@JonathanHoenig you have to be kidding. Shame on you!
@ChopReid Cruz fan?
"@BretBaier @JohnKasich @tedcruz Good Lord. Graciously bow out and live to fight another day. If Trump ""can't win"" only have to wait 4 years"
@IngrahamAngle Another loser who cares more for his/her own station than for the average American citizen
@KatiePavlich Obamas America...
@KTHopkins He's awful. History will judge him so... Worse than Jimmy Carter.
@BleacherReport @MotorCityGoBlue 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"@tedcruz @mike_pence All the way from Ohio, huh? That's far! Ohio people are so much different than us Hoosiers! Ohio pretty impt too, huh?"
@CatchLikeCalvin What site is that?
"@EnglandLion313 I'm actually not very optimistic about this season... I like what Quinn did in the draft, but that's for the future"
@EnglandLion313 Just Like the #Lions this season!
"@AllenWest That they think we will lose is just more evidence that we will win! Dole, McCain, Romney... They're always wrong!"
"@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump @facebook Great stuff as always, Newt? VP?"
@scrowder then the hashtag #NeverHillary is the one to follow!!
@NFL @MotorCityGoBlue @AlabamaFTBL Trent Richardson??😁😁😁
@ThoseDetGUYS Ellaborate please...
@ThoseDetGUYS @Garrccia_10 no. But a solid B. Ruddock and LS were a bit odd. Others solid
@MotorCityGoBlue @Lions Mike Thomas
"@DetLionBlood @protokj @Lions @CatchLikeCalvin Although I really wanted Mike Thomas S. Miss, over react much?"
@DetLionBlood Neither will be a starter. For a long time...
@JohnSiglerNFL @LedyardNFLDraft @ThoseDetGUYS yes. That one 😂😂😂 good thing I'm not picking
@LedyardNFLDraft @ThoseDetGUYS @JohnSiglerNFL Really. Dahl good player?! I wanted Mike Thomas from S. Car
@BrandonAlisoglu @JustWinDetroit @swarheit Open competition! I love this Quinn... Bring it!
@mikerothstein Mike Thomas!!
"@ColinCowherd @MotorCityGoBlue selection is fine, but he better be second coming of Jason Hanson."
@alex_reno love Thomas!  Also wouldn't hate Pharoh Cooper
@PrideOfDetroit I hope not.
@ReaganWorld @dbongino awful disease. Terrible for patient... And arguably even worse for families.
@TheLionsMan Pharoh Cooper
"@PJciampa I'm on the ""overrated"" and I guess the NFL agrees. Low completion% and getting bageled in the semifinal was the nail in the coffin"
@gglasgow61 @TDeck68 Welcome to the D! Have a great season!
"@MarkdominikESPN @ESPNNFL Strong draft, but maybe 2017 since their best pick won't play this season"
@JustWinDetroit Braxton Miller or Pharoh Cooper?
"@Justin_Rogers I hate the Buckeyes, but would love Braxton Miller or Pharoh Cooper"
@MotorCityGoBlue what's wrong with Simmons. Some wanted him in 2nd
@Espngreeny They are? What I miss?
@DetroitJockCity Happy. Now want Braxton Miller or Pharoh Cooper
@alex_reno @JustWinDetroit NYJ. Connor cook anyone?
@alex_reno @JustWinDetroit is A'Shawn better than Jarran?
@JustWinDetroit I hope @alex_reno is right
@JustWinDetroit I think he's good but @alex_reno doesn't apparently
@PrideOfDetroit @MikeSullivan And only a modestly good QB
@HotlineJosh that's cuz NFL is king
@DetLionBlood we get to see up close this season.
@MikeSullivan Hell NO!
