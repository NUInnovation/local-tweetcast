@Nysportsfan621 @DebAlwaystrump can't go wrong with Newt.
@Nysportsfan621 @DebAlwaystrump Yep! You're right.
@Nysportsfan621 @DebAlwaystrump True! Sessions been with him all the way.
@Nysportsfan621 @DebAlwaystrump Correct! I like that she supports him but she wouldn't be a good candidate for VP.
"@Nysportsfan621 @DebAlwaystrump Possible VP candidates would be Scott brown, christy, palin, huckabee, sessions, other supporters."
@BlissTabitha correct! Obama has destroyed the middle east!
@Squids_Politics @hotairblog Graham don't even listen to the people in his own state.
@BlissTabitha what many people been saying that the deal will start a nuclear race in the middle east.
"@StatesPoll If Hillary is having a hard time against Bernie, she's going to have a real hard time with trump!"
@MDontheright @realDonaldTrump Awesome!
@Nascar_Tom @rninfl I will have to agree with Egypt. But they are a lot smarter and took actions before it was too late.
@10thAmendment @JOEROWE409 @BreitbartNews What's the matter. Is he scared of the future boss?
@slone correct.
@FriendlyJMC @dever_o @kohlweiler @realDonaldTrump @immigrant4trump Trump 2016!!
@ocdnewsjunkie @kathystone1221 @WeNeedTrump Correct! That's irresponsible. Impeach him.
@kohlweiler @FriendlyJMC @realDonaldTrump @immigrant4trump If women don't want to suffer like in Germany now. Trump is the only answer.
@FoxNews @KirstenPowers @MittRomney correct! Only the ones that are against trump!
@Dianestraley oh yeah! Under what lie?
@AlyLovesMovies @realDonaldTrump people that are totally against the wall might be benefiting from drug trafficking and the cartels.
@asamjulian @AmaliaDiaz93 @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump it definitely won't work this time.
@NorthSTLCounty @Portosj81J we want to see real change in Washington. The same old stuff has to go.
@Portosj81J Correct! CHRISTIANS don't trust Obama. Coal miners don't trust Obama. Our allies don't trust Obama. Who then trust him ?
@NolteNC yep! They need a total cleansing. They won't listen to the people's voices.
@RogerJStoneJr @Contumedia @realDonaldTrump shows that republican establishment only care about their little club.
@Real_Estate_IM Great! He said right. Do what's right for the country.
@pink_lady56 @arrjet17 I guess I'm racist if I eat a taco bowl on 5 de mayo. What a bunch of idiots.
@PhxKen @Dixieglo True!
@JaredWyand @Dixieglo @elizabethforma Correct! Democrats live on lies.
@BreitbartNews @kyliving Michael Moore? Really!
@slone @BreitbartNews he should be in the psyche ward.
@AIIAmericanGirI what a loser!
@slone @syoka68 @TheLastRefuge2 That's true!
@HENSONmike @arrjet17 @realDonaldTrump Reason for the wall. 1 illegals. 2 drugs. 3 drug cartels. 4 ISIS. 5 to save money. TRUMP 2016!
@AJDelgado13 @HillaryClinton Right we do! And some spanglish also every now and then.
@BlissTabitha @Granner1 Democrats are full of BS. Every where you look there is a liar.
@syoka68 @CNNPolitics he knows what's best for November. Trump is the only one that can beat HILLARY.
@AIIAmericanGirI @FoxNews yeah! Another liar who benefited from her lie that she was native American.
@bazisgirl @teed_chris They must be stopped and never allowed to enter the USA.
@Callisto1947 The dude is a Muslim full of bigotry.
@10thAmendment @BreitbartNews Good!
@DianeHauschildt @003a04f8c2054b7 @SpeakerRyan @TheMattJansen Yes! But what goes up must come down! He's going to hit the ground.
@FoxBusiness @realDonaldTrump SMART AND GOOD FOR THEM. #NeverHillary . TRUMP 2016!!
@DRUDGE_REPORT @jphillipsjack @CBSLA of course. The left is either their way or no way. That why we need TRUMP.
@DanScavino Awesome!!!
@FoxNews @newtgingrich @HillaryClinton Then she has the evil face to lie to them in front of their faces.
@lauracgilleslil @katlivezey @SpeakerRyan @pnehlen @harrisonchief Ryan should be impeached.
@francisdominicu @syoka68 Where were you Hillary at 3 am whole our ambassador was under attack?
@unclebubba9 @syoka68 @NetworksManager Cruz=Evil liar as is the son of the devil.
@teed_chris Women! Wake up before it's too late or that head will be your son or husband's head. VOTE TRUMP 2016!
@AJDelgado13 @SpeakerRyan maybe!
@OBAMA_GAMES @cspanwj Correcto!! He would rather help his buddies than to help poor comunities.
@ed_hooley @ALLENnKELLY @Men Well. A liar will tell lies to cover her lies. She's a serial professional liar.
"@PamelaGeller @omartin41 Hmm! Lybia, iraq, syria, and he almost wrecked Egypt also. Except they were a lot smarter."
"@FoxNews @JamesRosenFNC can Hillary keep Bernie's supporters. Of not, she will loose. Trump will get most of them. Watch it!"
@cristinalaila1 correct! Hillary said she will continue Obama's policies and be like Merkel. Bad combination for USA.
@SMSS4 @DanSpeaksTruth yeah him and Hillary are not welcome in the coal areas.
@slone yep. Includes me. I don't watch much of FOX any more.
@AnnCoulter Why idiots from FOX keep saying college educated people will not vote for Trump. I'm college educated and I'm voting Trump!
@watersurf58 Cartels bribed our politicians. They're operating inside the USA. Build the wall. Shutt them out. Trump 2016!!
@LeahR77 #NeverHillary
@sandyaschneider Won 1 state. He's a DEMOBLICAN. Too much to the left for me to support him.
@AJDelgado13 I agree A.J.!
@Maxinerunner @Trump4Pres0225 @mitchellvii @FoxNews @AnnCoulter What a sad face. She's been Trumped!
@FoxNews @xkr99 @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump I'm glad you acknowledge that Geraldo. Although we all knew that long ago.
@FoxNews @DLoesch Don't be sad. Be happy!
@slone @GODZCHILD30240 The drug cartels will continue passing him money to the end. He's their last hope before Trump becomes POTUS.
@BigStick2013 @CashBama @BreitbartNews like I said. The GOP will destroy itself for ever if THEY pull that mess.
@slone @doctorglc77 true!
@NavyVets4Trump @Portosj81J @FoxNews Cartels in Mexico use illegal immigrants to smuggle drugs into the USA.
@syoka68 @Salon I love the Lord and Ted is no Jesus.
@RandPaul @HillaryClinton Hillary will continue Obama's job killing policies
@heavenlyitalian @Stonewall_77 they may have also been bribed by Mexican cartels.
@Tinawanis @RickCanton Learning and following his teachings were his instructions to all of us that believe in the truth.
@drogbae_ @Tinawanis That's correct! Learning and doing his teachings were his instructions.
@AmyMek I guess Kent can stone her to death.
@CourageOfWisdom Many of those negative polls must be polling democrat women.
@CCCINNC @Kotcha301 @YouTube Maybe she fainted when she saw Heidi.
@WDFx2EU @tedcruz Me and you both!
@mitchellvii I agree!
@Suthen_boy @BreitbartNews Yeah! It's bs that they can beat up on Trump supporters and the damn media will just ignore it.
@RoninGreg @dunn_cheri @Nero she looks like meat for the cartels in Mexico.
