@mikepfingston2 Since Dennis Sternizky was paid off to support Cruz he's been completely silent about Corker Bill and Cruzs Co-Sponsoring ot
"@mikepfingston2 ""These people in Washington, D.C., usurp the Constitution all the time"" Mark Levin That was Levin BEFORE he was paid by Cruz"
"@mikepfingston2 ""The United States Senate just rewrote the treaty provision of the Constitution""..."
@mikepfingston2 @TheLastRefuge2 Now Levin is totally quiet about it because Cruz and he have colluded against America and the Constitution
@mikepfingston2 @TheLastRefuge2 Levin was right when he said last July that the Republicans sold out when they passed the Corker Bill...
"@mikepfingston2 @TheLastRefuge2 No and just honest enough to admit it. Ive listed to Levin since 04, have ALL of his books..."
"@CoateDan @Patrici15767099 @theratzpack @Chrisd22000531 Thankfully that's not up to you. And by God's grace and will, Trump will prevail"
@WendyJoMason @CoateDan @theratzpack @Chrisd22000531 @Photogbill222 I keep a photo of her and Dom by my bed to remind me of my blessings
@WendyJoMason @CoateDan @theratzpack @Chrisd22000531 @Photogbill222 and Yes Sabine is a very good friend of mine.
@WendyJoMason @CoateDan @theratzpack @Chrisd22000531 Let member have their chance to share EVEN the ones who didn't support him.
@WendyJoMason @CoateDan @theratzpack @Chrisd22000531 And yes Trump was the only candidate who followed through with their project AND
"@WendyJoMason @CoateDan @theratzpack @Chrisd22000531 I never block, even the most ridiculous people. Unless you personally attack me"
"@PoliticalShort @NH92276 Whatever Conservatism is or was I'm positive it's not whatever Nathan Hale votes for, clearly."
@theratzpack the first person in the chain is always who I'm directly speaking to. You and I are good. ðŸ˜Š
@WendyJoMason @CoateDan @theratzpack @Chrisd22000531 @Photogbill222 and you're making an excuse for him lying. Which is nothing new
@WendyJoMason @CoateDan @theratzpack @Chrisd22000531 @Photogbill222 Really how has he DONE that?
@WendyJoMason @CoateDan @theratzpack @Chrisd22000531 @Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 Try asking her yourself since its no big deal SMH...
@pennybishop16 @Hotgas @C0nstantineXI Boom! Let's keep supporting @pnehlen
@Arteltoe @KarlRove @LeahRBoss @theyseeus2015 @PatrickLMcCoy4 @brandondarby Its all due to the Ouija board he draws on
"@WriteReadRock @superlioness1 Yeah, like Mark sold his soul to the devil Levin"
"@WriteReadRock @superlioness1 Yes, you are right. And to think that there are self-proclaimed conservatives who will vote for her. ðŸ˜µ"
"@ringod01 @WendyJoMason @theratzpack @Chrisd22000531 @Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 That would be Karl Rove's whiteboard, right?"
@WendyJoMason @CoateDan @theratzpack @Chrisd22000531 @Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 Here he is lying to her face https://t.co/2aZ8uthAb8
@WendyJoMason @CoateDan @theratzpack @Chrisd22000531 @Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 He promised he would call her about her murdered son
@WendyJoMason @theratzpack @Chrisd22000531 @Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 Thank you for making my point.
@Chrisd22000531 @theratzpack @Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 @WendyJoMason Yeah cause Cruz lying to a grieving mother is sooo SILLY right?
@CoateDan @theratzpack @Chrisd22000531 @Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 Truth matters to me. And Cruz is a man who uses people for gain
@CoateDan @theratzpack @Chrisd22000531 @Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 Cruz on the other hand lied to my friend and broke his promise to her
@CoateDan @theratzpack @Chrisd22000531 @Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 Spoke with him about his values. He was very gracious and kind to me
@CoateDan @theratzpack @Chrisd22000531 @Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 I don't worship Trump. But I do care enough to have met with him and
@Chrisd22000531 @theratzpack @Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 @WendyJoMason Youre in the bunker with Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren
@Chrisd22000531 @theratzpack @Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 @WendyJoMason You should tell Glenn Beck and Cruz's father that They don't know
@sizzlesride @Lonestarmomcom @spunkybm13 @Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 @WendyJoMason which Statement?
@sizzlesride @Lonestarmomcom @spunkybm13 @Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 @WendyJoMason ðŸ˜˜
@Lonestarmomcom @spunkybm13 @sizzlesride @Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 @WendyJoMason And yet I'm not the one whos tweeting fake tweets!
"@sizzlesride @Lonestarmomcom @Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 I'm misinformed, that's all Cruz peeps have cause they don't have truth"
@theratzpack @Chrisd22000531 @Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 @WendyJoMason https://t.co/3KexVoxyyq
@theratzpack @Chrisd22000531 @Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 @WendyJoMason They don't want to hear about that Cruz is Jesus for them.
@SSbridges51 @TheLastRefuge2 lol my auto correct always auto corrects Newt to Newton doh!
@RealTedZodiac @MrsParkington @MikeBates @seanhannity Amen! And they would have voted for Omibus bill
@RealTedZodiac @MrsParkington @MikeBates @seanhannity They certainly are no constitutionalist that's for sure
"@SSbridges51 @TheLastRefuge2 Absolutely, I wanted Huckabee and Newton as well."
@TheLastRefuge2 Wow! How far the mighty fall. Levin has utterly sold his soul. I'll never trust him again!
@Wade_Hummel @Patrici15767099 @Photogbill222 @Lonestarmomcom @WendyJoMason That you were on the Trump Train in 16. Just like Reagan 84
@Wade_Hummel @Patrici15767099 @Photogbill222 @Lonestarmomcom @WendyJoMason Youll all be back in 2020 singing Trumps praises and pretending
@Photogbill222 @Wade_Hummel @Lonestarmomcom @Patrici15767099 @WendyJoMason That explains a lot
@Wade_Hummel @Photogbill222 @Lonestarmomcom @Patrici15767099 @WendyJoMason By not voting for Trump you are electing Hillary.
@russellabaker @Photogbill222 @Lonestarmomcom @Patrici15767099 @WendyJoMason You Russell are the reason I'll have nothing to do w/ CruzCrew
@russellabaker @Photogbill222 @Lonestarmomcom @Patrici15767099 @WendyJoMason Oh! That's an excellent way to persuade a person. ðŸ˜•
@Photogbill222 @Lonestarmomcom @Patrici15767099 @WendyJoMason Cruz has said REPEATEDLY that he's FOR globalist trade &amp; has no intention 2fix
@Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 @WendyJoMason You do realize his wife wrote the road map to a NAU for the CFR? And he's for TPP/TPA &amp; RPI
"@Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 @WendyJoMason What do you expect me to think about a group whove called my unchristian, a whore, a cunt ect?"
@Lonestarmomcom @Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 @WendyJoMason I'll take my chances. We can't afford to elect another globalist like Cruz

@Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 @WendyJoMason https://t.co/eN7YanPror
@Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 @WendyJoMason IDK what you take out of context. Christ is VERY clear that He is the ONLY one 2 judge heart
@Photogbill222 @Patrici15767099 @WendyJoMason Perhaps Jerry Falwell Jr isn't Christian enough for you. He has testified to MANY attributes
"@Patrici15767099 @Photogbill222 @WendyJoMason Clearly Bill missed the verse judge ye not Matt 7:1-5 I guess he's too ""scholarly"" for that 1"
@ABC My guess is this is a test balloon to see if she will make a good VP pick for Killary. They'll test some rhetoric and see the results
@Rene_gadeCowboy If you're not interested in ending globalism and ensuring our Sovereignty then why even bother with a republic?
@Rene_gadeCowboy @legendre007 @JonathanHoenig @knelligan12 Thats nothing but rhetoric. It has no basis in reality and is a weak argument
@legendre007 @JonathanHoenig @knelligan12 At least he's actually spent a time on a construction site. How about you?
"@legendre007 @JonathanHoenig @knelligan12 For the rest of us ""little people"" we are suffering from the low manufacturing nightmare"
@legendre007 @JonathanHoenig @knelligan12 Thats easy for men like Hoenig who've never spent a day in a coal mine or running a coffee shop.
@IngrahamAngle How about we don't Tacobout and say we did. Let's get to the real issues. Jobs. Security. Trade. Immigration.
@RobbsbeachNY @ThePatriot143 @jeffsessions Jeff Sessions is a GREAT Patriot
@AIIAmericanGirI @LifeNewsHQ Clearly not. Just because your breathing doesn't make you human either.
@mitchellvii @FemalesForTrump I was wondering when that was going to happen. Issa has been one of the champions silenced by the globalists
"@tonyr951 @Amberis4LSU @Agent4Health @cinderella2b @GayleHall05 @sabine_durden To be clear, he promised to help her and never did"
"@tonyr951 @Amberis4LSU @Agent4Health @cinderella2b Yes I know, @sabine_durden is a good friend of mine She should NEVER be treated like that"
@gop The people are TIRED of being forced to pay for you're stupidity! We've had ENOUGH We The People want TRUMP! https://t.co/o53rzWWexd
@redhead4645 @seanhannity  Absolutely
"@seanhannity Thank you soooo much for speaking for us Sean. You, Laura and Newt have been so helpful to those of us screaming for change."
