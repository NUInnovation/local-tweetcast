@LWilsonDarlene Govt doesnt create jobs. If you abolished govt completely, that wouldnt create 1 job. Cruz hasnt created 1 real job.
@bterris Anti trump people are violent in word (death threats) and deed (protests) yet Trump is the bad guy. 1984 is here.
@kasperka Imagine if those streets were private instead of public. Protest problem solved. #MaRoads
@IngrahamAngle If you believe govt owns you like property, and has the right to tell you what you can put in your body, raise your hand.
@barbra2074 @IngrahamAngle The GOP there NEED to mellow out and stop with the gestapo tactics.
@guypbenson @SmallBiz4Trump Most all libertarians are banned from fox and cnn now. Ron Paul was totally marginalized.
@alivitali Meaning he had to take time out to deal with the bogus claims by fields.

@AblativMeatshld The truth is most media is owned by just 6 govt crony mega corps who are terrified Trump will cut their profits in half.

@BecketAdams He'll prob get a job at Salon. They're much more reputable. https://t.co/fOYnVGABUm
@BecketAdams Yet 99% of the media libelously calling Trump a racist con man hitler misogynist doesnt bother him at all. Give me a break.
