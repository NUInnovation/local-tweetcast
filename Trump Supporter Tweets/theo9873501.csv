@tladd58 and not soon enough
@peddoc63 @tgradous @RitzyBacon2 Londonstan
@BenHowe well at least Hillary will praise you as a 'thoughtful 'Republican
@PatrickRuffini hey the people seem to get him...check out his crowds
@Texasocialist @TheRickWilson @IMA_CA_GOPer @JuliannAndreen that's a good one Fred
@benshapiro SCOTUS on the line Ben...don't empower Hillary
@StefanMolyneux @Ricky_Vaughn99 it will get worse...they will flee the UK soon enough
@jaketapper @Ricky_Vaughn99 @CNNSotu @SpeakerRyan @SarahPalinUSA Ryan lost to Biden in the 2012 debate..he needs to go!
@TheRickWilson @joshgreenman @NYDailyNews I doubt Churchill would approve of trying to get Hillary elected
@TheRickWilson @trscoop every time you say he can't he seems to do
@RodUkip @MikkiL @DouglasCarswell @DJack_Journo we in the West are being attacked by liberalism and Islam...God help us all
@RedState try going to a Trump rally...y'all are out of touch...proudly voted for him in the Ga primary
@stuartpstevens @wpjenna @GlennKesslerWP he won it..Mitt had the benefit of full support ...Trump deserves the same
@TheRickWilson @Texasocialist @IMA_CA_GOPer @JuliannAndreen it will be Newt or Marco
@Jetwash @NRO same with George Will...NR not conservative...went from William to Christopher in a generation
@NRO y'all are incredible ...we finally have somebody that fights back against the Left and y'all are all in for Hillary..NR so out of touch
Trump is a true champion!
@pnehlen @P0TUSTrump he lost to that fool Biden...he has no political future
@Kyle_Feldscher @paulthomas1020 Jeb turned out to be a wuss...Hillary would have curbed stomped him
@stephenfhayes @SarahPalinUSA you sound like Schmidt and Wallace who undermined McCain's campaign from within ...Trump has exposed you all
@DrSueDVM @tgradous @RussSegner so your supporting Hillary..ok
@JRubinBlogger anything other than Trump helps Hillary...Bottom line
@DouthatNYT @RichLowry @ThisWeekABC where have you so called 'conservatives'gotten us?...Nothing
@dukenaltum @RussSegner @tgradous well y'all kept saying he would never win a primary...who is delusional?
@TheRickWilson @CNNPolitics good on her...and she was treated horribly by Schmidt and Wallace...2 inside libs McCain brought on board
@CNNSotu @oldguyinhemet @SenJohnMcCain @SarahPalinUSA he sure didn't fight then
@HawkinsUSA @khaft007 we are down to that
@TheRickWilson make one that makes today's people smarter ..that would be an accomplishment
@ByronYork that word compassion needs to be banned from the Right
@RussSegner @tgradous he lost...I am sorry but he was not strong enough to beat DT...all your railing won't change that
@JRubinBlogger @GlennKesslerWP he is the only Republican that does not go into the fetal position and fights the Left and Media
@RadioAnna now that's funny
@RussSegner @tgradous do you really believe the Establishment would have helped Cruz win?.Or Jeb would not take a dive ?
@JayCaruso in 2012 I expected he would defeat Biden in a debate...he really disappointed ..and as speaker he just has not won any victories
@PamelaGeller they better get used to more Sharia patrols
@JayCaruso @jaketapper @SarahPalinUSA @CNNSotu my only beef is she helped McCain in 2010 stay in the Senate..she is pretty but voice grating
@JRGrayThunder @ZachLthrmn @RandPaul @tedcruz @CarlyFiorina God y'all are sad
@FilibusterUK that's why they are bringing in more Muslims
@RussSegner @tgradous it's over...and DT is the only one that can put Ted on SCOTUS..besides the Establishment hates both DT and Ted
@jimgeraghty @benshapiro can't u guys give it a rest?
@DanRiehl @SeawordG @blakehounshell Trump is the least of the GOP's problems
@DanRiehl tell it Dan
@FrankLuntz Boxing is to corrupt...MMA is where it's at
@kris_kinder @JayCaruso @katooom @Nwatters @SpeakerRyan hate Kool aid and think for myself.
@JayCaruso @katooom @Nwatters @SpeakerRyan he is our shot at SCOTUS.I think if he picks Newt for VP and puts Cruz on the Ct even u will like
@FrankLuntz As a Trump Supporter I want his entrance music to be 'Imperial March(Vader's theme)..watch heads explode😀
@JayCaruso @katooom @Nwatters @SpeakerRyan we are 'stuck 'with him because the GOP E refused to defend its voters Jay
@BobGarrettRadio @CheriJacobus @greta @seanhannity it's over...Trump was chosen by the people ..not the elite..time to defeat Hillary
@minnman47 well deserved
@dcexaminer screw fat boy
@secupp @MahGill @Forbes we are moving towards a socialist society
@TheRickWilson @dynarski book em Dano😉
@weeklystandard @realDonaldTrump @McCormackJohn it's over..the only way to get Cruz on SCOTUS is Trump..the people have spoken
@michelekirkBPR he should not waste is time with little Sasse
@stuartpstevens nothing beats reading real hardcover books
@mitchellvii @zebra78610 glutton for punishment
@JayCaruso @EnemyWithinn well Jay I will keep using every argument I can't think of...night
@EnemyWithinn @JayCaruso at this stage we need to reach out...the future is on the line Jason
@peddoc63 @ONLYTrummp @Cruzvalues I want Ted replacing Scalia...Hillary won't appoint him...Trump will
@JayCaruso @EnemyWithinn I hope Jay you come around ..defeating Hillary and getting a Cruz to replace Scalia is vital to the future
@TheRickWilson @kgj3x @tconn Rick I hope you won't mind but I will keep calling you to the dark side ..Hillary must be defeated
"@seanhannity @stoyeneso @Season2Hunt National Review,Weekly Standard,and Red State detest everyday Republicans who voted Trump"
@OnlyHotyP @RNcat50 and not soon enough
@TheDonaldNews @LindaSuhler @realDonaldTrump win or lose the Don has defeated the Establishment Left who by the way did nothing for Cruz
@Peggynoonannyc I was not a fan of yours but your columns have been totally right without upturn noses of 'conservative 'writers..Trump 2016
@Peggynoonannyc @AlanSalazarCO Reagan was called a warmonger and a dunce...now those same people claim that Trump is no Reagan..Hypocrites
@RKirkland3 @_HankRearden @RNcat50 there has been an awakening....have you felt it?
@Mistertbones @mitchellvii and those amateurs and nevertrumpers are total losers
@markknoller it's remarkable Mark how Trump took over the GOP..
@OddLane sad losers
@seanhannity @HathornJim I pray Trump crushes Hillary and her Republican enablers

@7CGcpa @kelliwardaz @SenJohnMcCain @theblaze throw him out
@jimlibertarian @LodiSilverado @nypost I stand with Putin
@RedState I love the taste of your tears...it taste sweet..wether he wins or not Trump has exposed you alwayshillary ..let the GOP burn Libs
@EvolutionCosmic @stevedempsey65 he may lose
@NRO the people have spoken...and you no longer speak for conservatives
@JonKelvey NPR...of course
@myownpetard he was always a leftie
@markknoller @HowardU so can I be confident in my whiteness?
@mollyesque @mattklewis @waitwait @PJORourke he always was a leftie
@weeklystandard yet he beat yall
@JayCostTWS @BuzzFeedAndrew so?..y'all the GOP was in the ditch anyway...voting Trump...and against Isakson and Austin Scott..let it burn
@chuckwoolery if Hillary is elected destroying coal will simply be the start
@Patriotic_LPN1 @peddoc63 poor guy...not
