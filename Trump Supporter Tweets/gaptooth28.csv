@AlbionAwakes @guardian they're black so they can do whatever they want.  White females would be discharged and condemned for eternity.
"@chicagotribune Black lives matter, huh?  Hey, let blame the cops!"

@CSNPhilly @JSalisburyCSN Don't Panic! 😙 #Phillies
@chicagotribune when did a free foot massage become a bad thing? 😮 #CincoDeMayo
@chicagotribune That's his culture. That's how they settle disputes on the south side! Embrace it or else. #embraceblackculture
@chicagotribune Perfect example of why cops should just do nothing. If he gets away and hurts himself or stabs some other clown..#whocares
@TheEcoBunny @chicagotribune too bad the community doesn't show that much outrage for the dozen or so DAILY shootings/homicides in Chicago.
@phillydotcom @AP Guess we know who they'll be supporting...free cells phones for all 😅 except u suckers that pay ur bills.  #Thatsme 😕
"@NOLAnews NOPD hates providing a suspect description.  Be on the the lookout for ""men"".  #usualsuspects"
@justin_fenton @baltimoresun I wonder if the suspects were white mormon missionaries.  Any clue?
@weknowwhatsbest @MccurleyMaureen first things first.
@FOX10NewsNow @FOX10Phoenix All be the first ones to dial 911 when they're getting bashed over the head for their I phones too.  👮👏
@mdj17 @courierjournal every culture must be embraced except the white ones.
"@TimPrudente1 @baltimoresun So black lives don't matter, then?  Getting confused.  Doesn't matter, let's keep firing and arresting cops!"
"@NOLAnews He's thinking, ""this kid doesn't look nothing like me"" 😨 #who'surdaddy"
@USPS I'd like to send some of ur carriers a uniform to wear.
"@MiamiHerald welcome them with open arms, full dental plan, &amp; a monthly check.  #havingaparty"
@phillydotcom @phillyjesus whats jesus doing at an apple store?
"@my2bits4u @chicagotribune gun problem or black problem?  Oh, that's right, it's the guns fault, or the cops, or whitey. #BlackLivesMatter"
"@chicagotribune Calling black lives matter, where are u?"
@FOX5Atlanta What's there to investigate? They have a constitutional right to hit police. U can't tell ppl not to do that! 👮#BlueLivesMatter
"@baltimoresun new training shall b to drop weapon and run away yelling ""black lives matter"".  #Police  #Baltimore"
@iduncan @baltimoresun thats bcause we dont charge criminals anymore.  We apologize to them and charge the cops who caught him.  #MayDay
@NOLAnews Middle class whites lie waiting to ambush tourists just north of rampart.  Right?  #NOLA #truestory
@NOLAnews Who wants to bet that the robbers were white males?  Anyone???
@chicagotribune latin kings....is that anything like habitat for humanity? #Gangs
"@baltimoresun nothing left to do now but deny responsibility, blame the racist cops and riot!  #MayDay #baltimorestillrising"
"@baltimoresun @CommishKDavis let the pandering begin...may as well apologize and fire some cops now, commish."
@soulful_chica @chicagotribune

@SnackPatrol New Chicago pd training video.  #cops
@NOLAnews Time to install metal detectors then. 🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪
@phillydotcom Im sure they used a racial slur that justified their subsequent murder.  #allapologies
@chicagotribune All Stems from social injustice. The majority needs to b more sensitive to minorities needs &amp; provide for them. 😵 #equality
"@NOLAnews Relax, it's black culture. We need to accept &amp; embrace it &amp; shun our own. Let's tear down a confederate generals statue instead. 😵"
@chicagotribune They've been saying all along that white ppl commit the most crime and THIS proves it 😨.
"@MyPhoenix So, be on the look out for a man?  Thats great reporting."
@baltimoresun black youths work?
@wkamaubell @CNN They are all innocent.  We should apologize and set them free.  I suggest they take up residence close to you. #lockurdoor
Inconvenient truth  https://t.co/QgxGAGMB8C via @gatewaypundit
@baltimoresun Stay alive and on the payroll.  #BlueLivesMatter  👮
"@baltimoresun It was an accident. They only carry guns to protect themselves from racist cops, the KKK , and thugs from Habitat for humanity"
"@baltimoresun there will be affordable housing, free cell phones, free cable Tv...Not free for everybody.  Just the ones that don't work."
@NOLAnews North of Rampart 😀
"@FOX10Phoenix He was only carrying it to protect himself from racist cops, the KKK, and those thugs from Habitat for Humanity. #BLM"
@Cons_Nation That us next year but the flag will be black because its ok to offend white people.
"@MarnieLevy @FOX5Atlanta Wow, thought she would opt for a more inner city campus atmosphere.  #TempleMade"
@chicagotribune Nice well kept properties.  Is this considered a black neighborhood?
White people out of control.  #whitelivesmatter https://t.co/jgFRC2iPVW
"@natbib1 @WEWS Sure, why not?  Cops should just go buy him some to replace what he's lost.  #communitypolicing"
@stoner_lokz Ill take my chances.
@baltimoresun @DanRodricks There's always the weird white guy or two in the crowd.  😄
@cwellssun @baltimoresun Cops should have surrendered their weapons and protected this man's right to shoot at them. #BlueLivesMatter  👮🔫
"@justin_fenton @baltimoresun Take their weapons away.  Let them police with smiles, hugs, and candy.  👮🍫 #PolicingDialogue"
"@chicagotribune Go get 'em, Tiger. Just smile and say ""black lives matter"".  🔫🔪💊🔥 #ObamaOut"
@baltimoresun Cops need to concentrate their efforts in the white neighborhoods.  They're the worst.  🔫🔪🔥
@baltimoresun @BaltimorePolice Hugs for thugs 👮 💑.
@chicagotribune These must be predominately white neighborhoods.  White folk...beating people for deep dish and tip money.  #crackerjoke
