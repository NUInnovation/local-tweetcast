@JSmithAD41 @wigitgetit @Sanjay25_ get a high pair of boots for this one
@wigitgetit @JSmithAD41 @Sanjay25_ it's not like cruz wasn't known for some dirty tricks and the GOPe wasn't on the war path.
@wigitgetit @JSmithAD41 @Sanjay25_ in context. IF the nomination was stolen. They're still trying but doubt it's going to work.
@JSmithAD41 @wigitgetit @Sanjay25_ proof pls
apples and oranges.that makes no sense https://t.co/I3RpurScq6
@WalshFreedom @Erosunique the so called elites-like Kristol &amp; Wll-are a handful. They're irrelevant(just don't know it).The Cruzers-scary
@realDonaldTrump TRUTH https://t.co/Sco8fOIKmV
@JudgeMoroz @realDonaldTrump @GOP they don't get that. No matter how many times you tell them LOST they still think WON.

@Patrici15767099 Cruz's self righteousness and phony act are what sent me for the hills from him. ALMOST supported him.
@GrayerDreams @AJDelgado13 letting ppl die in the streets is conservative?
@Patrici15767099 here's how Cruz gets his 'followers'  Cruz wins the technology war  https://t.co/HbhlgOZr3H via @YouTube BRAGGED about it
@Patrici15767099 Trump says hell and damn and everyone goes crazy.Cruz lies and cheats Dr Carson in Iowa-crickets
"@Patrici15767099 if Cruz-&amp; not Trump-were all that why would Dr Carson,Huckabee and Falwell pass over Cruz for Trump? Hmmm?"
@Patrici15767099 yep. 100%. hits nail on head. they need to take a real look at Cruz too.

@PMgeezer @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump good advice but from what i'm reading it's already too late.
@cindievaccaro @KatrinaPierson @oliverdarcy you know what you said Ms Pierson. their reasoning is a tad convoluted. they don't get it.
@cindievaccaro @KatrinaPierson @oliverdarcy @YouTube Trump has supported many Rep candidates.Reality Check Cruz-&gt;https://t.co/DzHlIdBTwO
@cindievaccaro @KatrinaPierson @oliverdarcy @YouTube you can get his voting record. i believe it's public REGISTERED REP

@mdsmelser @ClarkeMoore Reality Check: https://t.co/DzHlIdBTwO  I almost got behind Cruz. ALMOST
@mdsmelser @ClarkeMoore if it comes from Cruz or a Cruz supporter i always check out the accusation. it's almost always a LIE.
@mdsmelser @ClarkeMoore LIE. the interview mentioned no time line or date specific whatsoever. Want the transcript? Cruz supporter?
