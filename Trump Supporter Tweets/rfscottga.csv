"@vhfancc @P0TUSTrump Yes indeed :) He Came, He Saw, He Stood Tall. Haters be gone...Trump's in the house!  Headed for the WH. Trump 2016!"
@vhfancc @GaetaSusan Well said friend. Well said indeed. We've too long given n2 juvenile pc whining. Been a looong 7 years. Enough already!
"@tedcruz says Trump is ""insider"". That's odd LyingTed bcause ""ultimate insider"" is EXACTLY what Fiorina called YOU. Oh yeah...and ""divisive"""
"@TheColdCivilWar @Buc_fever No friend, u fought for rest of us who actually appreciate ur sacrifice. Not for these violent wastes of oxygen"
"DON'T STAY HOME ELECTION DAY, if Trump is denied this nomination!  It's what THEY want. It will be OUR turn to ""Protest"" and PACK @GOP BAGS!"
"@GOP If you deny Trump this nomination, I'M NOT STAYING HOME ON ELECTION DAY! We will be helping YOU pack your bags. OUR turn to ""Protest"""

"@rescuetracker81 @Chris11962 Jobless trash and ""victims"" of free education, abusing our flag. Sickening! This is NOT Freedom of Speech"
Since when can you throw ANYTHING at a police officer or tear down a barricade and it not get you arrested? Trump rioters should GO TO JAIL!
@TheColdCivilWar @AnnCoulter We've fallen far these past 8 years. Sad when crime is even televised and STILL goes unpunished #ArrestRioters
"@jkvegas777 @lsferguson When they tore barricade down,WHY were they not arrested? NOT protestors, rioters should be arrested. Makes me sick!"
Protestors holding signs End White Supremacy &amp; waving Swastikas! Where do these juvenile idiots come from? GROW UP! Fakers looking for attn!
"Herman Cain: ""These (Trump) protestors have drank the fool-aid""  Well said, sir. They r NOT protestors, they are illegal rioters #ArrestThem"
"How proud they must be, these Trump protestors, foul little jobless trash who jump on complete strangers when police aren't looking #COWARDS"
"@mitchellvii @BlueSkyNJ Hmmm...wasn't it Fiorina who CLEARLY described @tedcruz as ""ultimate insider"" and ""too divisive""? WOW...what a pair!"
"Fiorina firing 18,000 employees &amp; outsourcing 30,000 more...yes, that would certainly decrease the company debt. Nahhhh, We'll Stay w/ Trump"
NOW HEAR THIS! @FoxNews @CNN  You came...You saw...You FAILED!  Keep supporting biased reporting for empty promises from historic liars.
NOW HEAR THIS! @GOP Read your history books! We didn't become a great nation by taking a knee to YOU! Support OUR VOTE FOR TRUMP or GET OUT!
NOW HEAR THIS! @tedcruz You fought for our Constitution UNTIL it didnt benefit YOU. You have disgraced your post...You are done! GET OUT!

@rock2352 @BabyJimbo48 @HillaryClinton We're not dealing w/same blind catalyst that put Obama in ofc. Dems left poor to get poorer #Betrayal
"@rock2352 @BabyJimbo48 @HillaryClinton Yes indeed. Hillary's about to see that her $ won't win this election, nor will it absolve her crimes"
"@tedcruz found ANOTHER opportunist. Fiorina who described Ted as ""ultimate insider"" &amp; ""too divisive"". Will she trample our Constitution TOO?"
"@GOP Do WE need to say it FOR you?  @realDonaldTrump WILL be nominee. Come on GOP......You can say it.  We are there, it's time. #Trump"
"@MariuAntonini @Carolin17951107 Ha! My vote's for Trump but must confess I've LOVED seeing ole Bern handing Hillary her hat, state by state"

@sbraz43 Carson is great guy....good man :)
"Haters STILL harping on Trump taxes when THEY KNOW it's spin. IRS has audited 2002-2008 and found NOTHING WRONG. Get over urselves, haters!"
"https://t.co/VuNVcRb3rr This @CheriJacobus  is piece of work! She's a Trump hater but ""Closet"" Dem maybe? NOT a reporter of ANY sort...Wow!"
"@risetoflyy @CheriJacobus First, Cheri claimed she NEVER asked Trump for a job but she had to FIRST admit SHE LIED to file her lawsuit"
@risetoflyy @CheriJacobus U hear Cheri is now trying to sue Trump for twitter defamation? Cheri had to admit her Twitter posted LIE to do it
"@risetoflyy @CheriJacobus You got that right, friend. One would think haters, like Cheri, would see hating on Trump is tanking their careers"
"Child @CheriJacobus hating on Trump AGAIN. Bright lights from ""good old days"" still blind her. Thinks hating on Trump will get her fame back"
@risetoflyy  Any Patriot blocked by obsessed juvenile pathological liar @CheriJacobus is a friend of mine. People's vote is for Trump 2016!

"Any doubters out there STILL think @tedcruz stands for Constitution?  LIAR TED, you stood by &amp; let Colorado voters be denied! #HypocriteLiar"
