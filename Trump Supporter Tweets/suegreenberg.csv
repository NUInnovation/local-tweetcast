@FoxNews @newtgingrich @MittRomney trump was his buddy when he gave Romney money. What a looser. Shows zero class.
@mitchellvii maybey he will ask Jeb bush to be vice.   Lol. Jeb is too weak and I use to like Jeb.
@karma1244 @AP Paul Ryan needs to grow a pair and support trump   . He owes it to the people
@Eliz_Hightower he's a jerk.  Trump was his friend and gave good money to his stupid campaign.
@wishful4me @Patriotic_Me @realDonaldTrump have to unify the party. Love trump. Hillary needs to be in jail
So many woman I ask love trump. Tired of the media saying they do not. Hillary is the devil. https://t.co/wFMncELsu1
Josh for trump.  We won indiana https://t.co/ADMuxJTurG
@Patriotic_Me Cruz is a slime bag. He probably will run independent to ruin trumps chances.   Trump is the man
@GovBrewer @realDonaldTrump that's sad. There's so much cheating
@IvankaTrump @MariaBartiromo congratulations
My names Ellie. Im voting for trump and so are all my friends https://t.co/1uLlGVje59
@Hashtag1USA @TrumpRollsOn @mitchellvii is trump or Cruz leading in the poles in Indiana. Hopefully trump
@NotCoolDork @RebeccaFaussett @SenatorRonbo @mitchellvii Cruz never signed someone's paycheck.  Look how many people trump employed
@mitchellvii I really think he wanted to say he's voting for trump but sleezy Cruz had something under his sleeve that made him vote for him
@VickyBrush @suegreenberg @GovPenceIN @realDonaldTrump I agree Vicky.  He said better things about trump than Cruz
@pig4801kj @LiveNewsyTweets @sandykjack @GovPenceIN the government acted like he was in pain trying to endorse an idiot. Cruz lies so much
@JustDonPerla @SIERRADEDORADO7 @USAHipster he's trying to get re elected.  Why choose a liar like Cruz. Political crappppp
@VickyBrush he acted like he had to endorse trump. Said nice things about trump
@mitchellvii he started talking about how great trump was doing. He acted like he was paid off to endorse Cruz.
