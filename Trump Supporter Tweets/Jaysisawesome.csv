@realDonaldTrump I will have to check it out the next time I'm in NYC!!! :-)
@realDonaldTrump
BYE BYE LYIN' TED!!! :-)
@realDonaldTrump @KarlRove HE still thinks MITT ROMNEY WON the 2012 ELECTION!!!
@mitchellvii He's CANADIAN! His VERY CANDIDACY is UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
"@mitchellvii She must want to set a WORLD RECORD FOR FAILURE. HEWLITT PACKARD U.S. SENATE, 2016 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION now this TRAIN WRECK"
@AnnCoulter Or a WALKING STICK or a CANE!
@ksfay5 Saw some of if on CNN. Will listen to it again.
@natashakorecki @politico Should be 15 YEARS!!!
@michaeljohns @realDonaldTrump LONG PAST TIME!!!
If CANADIAN TED CRUZ tries to defeat TRUMP on a SECOND BALLOT then CANADA should send over a BUNCH OF DELEGATES to VOTE for THE DONALD!!!
"@mitchellvii @lambert_craig Calls himself THE ""CONSTITUTIONAL CONSERVATIVE, yet his VERY CANDIDACY is UNCONSTITUTIONAL, as a CANADIAN!!!"
@BecchettiFred @mitchellvii I live inCANADA but I wish I could be there HELPING OUT!!!
@realDonaldTrump This is ONLY the BEGINNING of WINNING!!! :-)
@realDonaldTrump You've reached the 50% threshold which all THE HATERS said you couldn't ever do!!! :-)
@foxnation @JudgeJeanine HELL YAH!!!
@realDonaldTrump Of course it's FALLING APART! What did you expect? Look who the SIGNATORIES ARE!!!
@realDonaldTrump YOU WERE SUCH an INSPIRATION!!! :-)
@Report24CA we need THE DONALD to come to CANADA'S RESCUE!!!
@realDonaldTrump HE'S SO DESPERATE!!!
@realDonaldTrump They are PATHETIC! Their poll numbers combined will end up even LOWER than each one's individually!!!
@realDonaldTrump Well JOHN KASICH just kissed any hope of being the VP PICK GOODBYE!!!
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @AP It's because of you!!! :-)
@shadohchaser It repeats on FOX.
"@realDonaldTrump @BorisEP @JudgeJeanine Recorded it, can't wait to watch!!! :-)"
@realDonaldTrump He's going to annoy you so much that he will have no chance of being your VP pick. His conduct is very self defeating!!!
@realDonaldTrump Let's aim for ALL 172 DELEGATES!!! :-)
@realDonaldTrump This is what I like to see!!! :-)
@realDonaldTrump This would put you OVER THE FINISH LINE!!! :-)
@realDonaldTrump Let's see if we can get it EVEN HIGHER!!!
@realDonaldTrump Nothing would make me prouder!!! :-)
RIP PRINCE! You will be sorely missed!!! :-(
@Drudge_Report_ They need a YUUUGE OVERHAUL!!!
@politico @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump My how the WORM HAS TURNED! Would LYIN' TED like some cheese with THAT WHINE?
@Eliottirado @mitchellvii From your lips to God's ears!!!
@mitchellvii Most of the people who do turn up are probably paid staffers!
@AnnCoulter SHOVELLING MANURE!
@AnnCoulter GREETER AT WAL- MART
@KThomasDC @sahilkapur @taddevine In other words preparing to drop out! :-)
@mitchellvii will the HATERS let us have any enjoyment!
@realDonaldTrump You CERTAINLY DESERVED IT!!! I LOVE NEW YORK. Hoping for ALL 95 DELEGATES!!! :-)
@politico @jnshinkle Which he ma very well lose!!! :-)
@Mediaite @AnnCoulter BETTER LATE THAN NEVER!
@jneutron1969 @RogerJStoneJr @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump WHO JEB BUSH?
"@jneutron1969 @RogerJStoneJr @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump He's not, he's just SO OVER IT!!!"
@RogerJStoneJr Because he knows the grassroots voters don't want him!
@realDonaldTrump NEW YORK will remain true to her VALUES and SO RIGHT by HER FAVORITE SON!!! :-)
@realDonaldTrump And NEW YORK HATES HIM!!!
@j_hotz @arnaudgroussard He will NEVER SUCCEED!!!
@FoxNews @DonaldJTrumpJr @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump From your lips to GOD'S EARS!!!
@politico ANOTHER TRAVESTY! PAYBACK will come over the next 2 TUESDAYS in a MAJOR WAY! CAN'T WAIT!!!
@Jyt1251John @politico That is exactly what THE DONALD is trying to fix. KASICH is basically staying in the race after having already lost!
@politico Yes but John KASICH can never accumulate enough delegates even if EVERY SINGLE PERSON in the country votes for him!
@realDonaldTrump He's on a DOWNWARD TRAJECTORY!
@Trumptbird I miss this SO MUCH!!! :-)
@realDonaldTrump @Trumptbird WARMS MY HEART!!! :-)
@michaeljohns The left knows Ted Cruz will never win. They would rather see him get the nomination!
@realDonaldTrump @Trumptbird Let's KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED!!!
@politico He's a PIECE OF SHIT!!!
@realDonaldTrump @dmharvey89 @wdct8110 THE DONALD needs as many votes as he can get out of INDIANA to give him MOMENTUM for CALIFORNIA!!!
@PeterBeinart GROSS! :-(
@Kotcha301 @mitchellvii Do you have to live I RI?
@realDonaldTrump I wish I could be there!!!
@Drudge_Report_ @politico This is great news! That he was even charged is a TRAVESTY!!!
@RogerJStoneJr I don't TRUST HIM!!!
@realDonaldTrump let's see if the MEDIA TRUMPets this VICTORY or they GLOSS OVER IT hoping no one will notice!
@realDonaldTrump ABOUT FUCKING TIME!!! :-). If it were LYIN' TED it would take I HOUR not 1 MONTH and lots of talk about his inevitability!
@mitchellvii I wish I could bring 200 DELEGATES from CANADA! Wouldn't be any less absurd or corrupt than what is already going on!
@joshtpm @ddale8 He's a PERVERT!!!
@AnnCoulter worst case scenario will come to Cleveland from Canada with 200 DELEGATES for THE DONALD!!! :-)
@AnnCoulter KEEPING MY FINGERS CROSSED!
