@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump love you @GovMikeHuckabee !! Thank you for backing Mr. Trump!!
@realDrumpf @realDonaldTrump I do.
@thehill Ryan needs to get his head out of his ass &amp; stop being pressured by the other so-called big-wigs needs to see Trump can do so much.
@Kotcha301 I think that is awesome!! Means more and more are learning the real man behind the flash. That there is substance there. #Trump.
TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!
@thehill Good luck. They will be ran over by the Trump Train.
"@realDonaldTrump Yes, Yes you will!"
They made such a fuss when Trump said he would not back the candidate of the GOP. Now look at them running tails between legs. Asses GOTrump
@usatodaylife @USATODAY Gold digger! Gotta Stupid!
@HillaryClinton SPEAK ENGLISH. YOU ARE IN AMERICA AND WE DO NOT SPEAK SPANISH.
"@thehill Yea, we don't like you either Mr. EX President.  #TrumpTrain ."
@KLSouth @GayleHall05 Thank you for posting this so people are aware.
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine Great!!
@LindaSuhler She is napping. I heard she does that a lot.
@USATODAY Wonder if he is now burning in hell if that is true.
"Awwww, the old school politicians don't want to play nice at the Republican National Convention  (Bushs, Rommney), Good. Poor losers."
@Rockprincess818 Don't we all wish we could take a nap by 10am.
@mitchellvii That is strange. And they call that proper voting? I think it is all rigged.
@thehill Why are they not crying about Clinton tweeting in Spanish today.
@joannesmoot @thehill Being overly politically correct is just as bad as bullying.
@thehill Good. Maybe Clinton is next.
"@EricTrump @ErinBurnett Be calm, smile, be relaxed and open, you'll be great! We all support you on the Trump Train."
"@asamjulian @HillaryClinton What happened to speaking the language of the country you live in, that is part of the problem."
"@HillaryClinton Hillary (orstaff)is tweeting in Spanish, how cute. I am an American and cannot read it. Do I have a law- suit? #NeverClinton"
@thehill HEY! Paul Ryan! Trump Train is watching you! We The People pick our President. We do not need your permission or approval. MASA.
@kinni00 @Oldfolksmatter @jorgeramosnews You'll get over it :-)
@SavageNation @BreitbartNews There are a lot and they sign up to vote when renewing their drivers license then vote for Bernie &amp; Clinton.
@ShannonSanford9 I wish that I could re-tweet this like a thousand times.
@slone @YahooCanada So bad. Wake up world!! Or you won't be allowed to live unless you bow down to their laws. Hello!! Stupid! Wake Up!!
@Dinky_1953 @mitchellvii There is no such thing as free health care.  Not in the U.S.A.
@ShannonSanford9 My guns and I agree with you!
"@realDonaldTrump Take a day off, sleep all day and relax. You deserve it. Then, when ready, Attack! You still have a lot of work to do!!"
"@thehill Yea, something useful."
@thehill Biting the hand that feeds him.  Not good.
