@fireflydelight @WeNeedTrump How about we declare Obama a traitor. He went to Supreme Court to get Muslim refugees here against our will.
"@LGwalt @NolteNC He said he saw a picture that depicted Cruz dad with a would be assassin, (enquirer) You are exaggerating what was said."
@F22Ross @FestusWalker @realDonaldTrump How about Condoleezza Rice? I think she would be a great choice.
@PaulRyanSpeaker @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @FoxNews https://t.co/CxwVFhN0wP
@Brandon_and_Son @marciapski3 @TruthFeedNews Remember the traitor was standing on the flag that day too. He needs a good long visit to jail.
@jaketapper Cruz would have lost if Abe Lincoln was his running mate. He needs to accept that we don't want him as President.
https://t.co/lkiOV0711P
@Patrici15767099 @jazz1294u @thee88plyr @NAARobertWilson The enquirer posted it and one other magazine. Trump only mentioned the photo.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @MSNBC @CNNPolitics @LouDobbs @seanhannity @oreillyfactor https://t.co/HWxprf1xtk
@pnehlen I voted Romney too. Never again. I thought he was a God fearing Christian. He turned out to be a hate monger and traitor to Rep.
@CatesVc @SoCal4Trump @lesstaxingcpa @LindseyGrahamSC I don't care about a presidents personality as long as he is a strong leader.
@alyseppala6 @SoCal4Trump @LindseyGrahamSC @DonaldJTrump Hope you remember to vote Graham out when his term is up.
@jackbgoode1 Powerful message!
@TressaMann3 @realDonaldTrump Exactly. All the incumbent Rep. vote them out. Put some fresh air in the government and get old snakes out.
@risetoflyy @Tobymare @SpeakerRyan Unbelievable. They are going to destroy this country.
@susana_holzer @carolinagirl217 @realDonaldTrump Campaigning against Trump is campaigning for Hillary. Does Ryan get that!!
@teekaylashots Bernie will never be able to get congress to pass free stuff law. It's just a very smart way to get votes and it's working.
@PatDollard @SharonMcCutchan @PRyan @realDonaldTrump Obviously Ryan broadcasted it to help the Republican Party lose once again.
"@Italians4Trump @CtBrokerRoks @JebBush The traitors to our party. Jeb, Ryan and Graham proved they don't care about us. Trump was right!"
@SharonMcCutchan @PaulRyanSpeaker Paul Ryan and L. Graham should know that slandering trump is campaigning for Hillary. Stupid idiots!!
@MSNBC @CNNPolitics @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @PaulRyanSpeaker You are proving Trump was right. You don't give a damn about this country.
"@joepalojoe @politico Well, the angry Rep. voters in SC will remember this. When his term is up they will send Graham packing."
@MSNBC @FoxNews @CNNPolitics @realDonaldTrump @PaulRyanSpeaker Does rep. Cong. know they infuriate us Rep voters by not caring if we win!
@WV4TRUMP1 Awesome!!
@gary_causer @Davebhaase @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @risetoflyy Suspending campaigning is not dropping out of the race. They are still in!
@EvelynGarone @NancycBa1 I heard WV automatically gives all delegates to last man still campaigning. I hope that's true.
@JerryFande @Charlie4Trump @slone @realBrianTrump I just heard WV automatically gives all the delegates to last man standing.
@Canine_Rights @realDonaldTrump Are you sure?  WV actually doesn't need to vote?  I hope you are right?
"@gary_causer @risetoflyy Trump is actively campaigning!  So why  would he think they don't need to vote? Geez, this is awful."
"@DanScavino @realDonaldTrump @FLGovScott If that's true, you need to tell him to get the message to his voters they still must vote!!"
"@DanScavino We are hearing Trump telling voters no more primaries and no need to vote. Please tell us this isn't true. He still needs 1,237."
"@risetoflyy I can't believe this. Who is telling Trump this lie! OMG, the GOP must be scheming to stop the voters!  @realDonaldTrump"
"@realDonaldTrump We are hearing you are telling people not to vote in the primary!! I hope that isn't true. You still need 1,237 delegates!"
"@republicknicks @The_Trump_Train Good Lord. No, the people must still vote!  Trump still needs 1,237 delegates!! Who told him to say that?"
@Ma1973sk @klik3x That's right. Suspending campaign doesn't mean they are out. They just stop campaigning but still plan on winning!
@greta @mitchellvii @RealBenCarson @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @LouDobbs Who is telling Trump to tell voters not to bother voting for him?
"@JerryFande @Charlie4Trump @slone @realBrianTrump @realDonaldTrump Good Lord, why would Trump tell his voters not to vote?  He needs votes!"
