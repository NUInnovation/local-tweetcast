@realDonaldTrump @KarlRove Fox must have a iron clad contact with Rove because he has to be hurting their ratings. Waste of air time.
@RickRWells Wow!  What a devastating slip of the tongue from Heidi for the Cruz campaign.  Punishment for saying anything to win.
"@Veteran4Trump This Pence sound bite need to be put in a Trump ad in Indiana, on radio, social media, etc."
"@USAforTrump2016 Now if these people at rallies will get out and vote for Trump.  Some are
Re merely curious."
@LoveMyTrump A dirty Florida poll caused Trump to stay in Florida longer when he needed to go to Ohio.  He may have one Ohio w/extra days.
@mitchellvii @ThePatriot143 Are you sure this isn't a wedding party being introduced?
@CNNPolitics @danmericaCNN If Trump standing up for America creates violence so be it. This violence can only be stopped with leadership.
@ChuckHodgson1 @bigboater88 Cruz so obsessed smith Trump he lost his own message.  Negative campaign sign of weakness. Always loses.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump That will changed as electorate gets to know Trump.  It is all contrived.
@betsy_klein @ameripundit Voters tired of Cruz/Fiorina lies &amp; arrogance. Let's move on to get rid of Hillary Clinton.  Waste no more time.
@FoxNews Yep.  I said it would.  She is so disdainful.  Thinks she's so clever.
@ffweekend @realDonaldTrump Why hasn't somebody picked up on Hillary discriminating against American Indian.
@ffweekend @realDonaldTrump Demeaning to Trump; Demeaning to American Indians.
@TeamTrumpNC @DRUDGE_REPORT Typical politician
@pRESIDENT_ALIEN Jane Iredale Mineral Cosmetics and Dermalogica skin care products can transform.  No criticism intended. Check them out.
@Crystal4Trump @dixiefortrump Slip of the tongue for the truth to be revealed. Truth prevails.
@Ma1973sk @bigboater88 Unbelievable.  Lies will eventually catch up with you.
"@megynkelly @DougBrunt had to make sure Michael Kelly isn't my son-in-law, the best cosmetic dentist in Scottsdale, AZ. ðŸ˜Š"
Poll: Trump way ahead of Cruz in Indiana @CNNPolitics https://t.co/x7sZeMMhZl
@Mediaite why would one ever think Cruz would support Trump if he is the nominee? He has been a major ingredient in DC gridlock.
@mitchellvii Cruz stealing Colorado delegates was the beginning of his downfall in free fall mode.
@SundayFutures @newtgingrich @MariaBartiromo Cruz is playing all angles as his candidacy proceeds with desperation.
"@5945USARTR @mcicero10 @DefendingtheUSA @TruthFeedNews As she wore skin tight pants, no doubt.  Our First Lady she can not be."

@SundayFutures @MariaBartiromo Ben was on fire with his analyses and comments.
@SundayFutures @RealBenCarson @realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo Wow!  Carson spoke with enthusiasm and conviction!  Great to see!!!
"@Mediaite Cruz should be the poster boy for corrupt, dishonest politicians voters need to get out of office."
@RickRWells Is it simply bad taste or is there a motive for Heidi to wear pants so tight they leave little to one's imagination?
@CNNPolitics how does Cruz propose transgenders be singled out? Should they be checked by making them pull up their skirts?
@CNN Everyone entering is a potential predator-not transgenders in particular. Women's bathrooms have separate stalls for privacy.
@CNN Bathroom situation is fine now except they should be kept cleaner.  Parents must supervise children as most do.
@CNN Transgender doesn't equal molestor. Most molestors not transgender. Uproar created for political purposes.
@TeamTrumpNC @surftheturf @FoxNewsSunday Cruz unhinged on CNN this morning as he ranted about Trump. Jake Tapper's look priceless.
@DanScavinoCruz says he wants voters to see the whole package.ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
@CNNPolitics Bet Wilmore doesn't get blasted for talking about Trump's genitalia and inappropriate comments. Where did they find this guy?
@dcexaminer This Wikmore guy is simply not funny.  Who writes this stuff?
@peaceandjoy101 Not funny.  disgusting.
@DiamondandSilk @larrywilmore getting ready to post the same thing when I saw this comment. Not funny.

Please retweet. https://t.co/QiudF404Vv
@immigrant4trump @snooozzzze This is great
@ClassySnobbb @dixiefortrump @tedcruz Smart assessment!
@TrumpTrain8 @dcexaminer I thought the same thing but their argument is that Cruz's parents citizens. No court determination ever made.
@jaydiesel0001 @FriendlyJMC @megynkelly @WestJournalism I said ratings are the only reason Megyn Kelly visited Trump Tower
@lynmacjay @FriendlyJMC @WestJournalism Understandably so the way Fox has changed on many programs.
"@ByronYork kind of like burning both ends of the candle on this one...immigrant, natural born, dual citizenship."
"@DefendingtheUSA They were't protests.  They were riots. Criminals, thugs, illegal immigrants with few well meaning protestors."
@matthewjdowd His history in congress and many primary states lost proves he can't win support for general
@TrumpTrain8 Vote Cruz if you want continued gridlock in DC. Does not get along with anyone.  Must make good deals-Cruz proved he can't.
@TrumpTrain8 Politicians like Cruz one of reasons for D gridlock. I'm conservative but must compromise &amp; negotiate.  Cruz proved he can not.
@BreitbartNews Maher is a dismal failure.  He is suppose to be a comedian
"@PatriotVote2016 @bigboater88 depends on how ""presidential"" is defined. Bill Clinton &amp; interns, Hillary &amp; Benghazi &amp; emails?"
"@mitchellvii Trump doesn't need trickery, bribery, lies and false polls to win the nomination-no back room deals typical for a politician."
@odulzaides @FriendlyJMC @GovPenceIN Did Pence say why he is voting Cruz?
@LoveMyTrump The one who admires Hillary Clinton and then denies it for political ambition.
@alcardfan @mcicero10 @realDonaldTrump Only if you're a thug or criminal intending to shut down free speech instead of protesting.
"@mitchellvii A single, unreliable poll unfavorable to Trump came out in Florida shortly before the primary. Made Trump work harder."
