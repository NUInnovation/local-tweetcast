Brion McClanahan - Trump: What American Conservatism Needs https://t.co/NVyMeVGG2Y
Money or influence most likely reason for a prominent conservative or Republican to oppose @realDonaldTrump now. https://t.co/tr4aWzfZqu
"""Citing #AnnCoulter w/o ridiculing her or denouncing her is an autoblock."" -- @TracyJeffords , of the #NeverTrump crowd."
"RINO Ryan has a certain ring to it, n'est-ce pas?"
"Despite many serious problems for our nation, all the #NeverTrump crowd (seemingly) cares about is DJT isn't polite enough for their taste."
"Our military has been weakened not just by Dem Obama but also by the Pub neocons who got us into unnecessary, costly wars with no success."
"@TracyJeffords I like @realDonaldTrump 's positions, including aversion to unnecessary costly wars, but also the fact that he's a fighter."
"@TracyJeffords If McCain and Romney had fought harder, we'd have more wins downballot, even if they themselves still had lost."
"@TracyJeffords Do you prefer gentlemanly losers like McCain and Romney, who let Dems get away with their usual vicious attacks?"
"@TracyJeffords As Ann Coulter said, the only issue that matters this year is immigration, b/c if we lose on that one, America will disappear"
RINO Ryan won't back Trump.  He'd rather support the lobbyists for the big corporations and foreign governments. https://t.co/ei1mZ0iqZb
"@TheJMurphy @shelbydoll1 @WeNeedTrump  Yes, except for some sore losers like Bush and some RINOs like Paul Ryan."
"@jackivinson @ChuckNellis As a practical matter, we can't send everyone back.  But we can stop more from coming."
#NeverTrump people backed McCain and Romney and they still lost.  So their support isn't that big a deal.
@jackivinson @ChuckNellis Trump also vows to oppose the anti-Christian bigotry that is so prevalent today.
@jackivinson @ChuckNellis Trump also opposes bringing in Muslims from war zones.  These people are a danger to our country.
"@jackivinson @ChuckNellis Non-citizens take jobs from our native poor, especially blacks.  Big business (""conservatives"") supports this."
"@jackivinson @ChuckNellis The Democrats keep complaining about income inequality, but they keep importing poor people."
"@jackivinson @ChuckNellis Immigration by poor, from Mexico, Central and South America, elsewhere is bankrupting our schools, hospitals."
"@jackivinson @ChuckNellis I especially like his not wanting to get US into unnecessary wars, like conservative Bush.  It cost US a lot."
"@jackivinson @ChuckNellis Tax reform is cuts for most people, closing loopholes, like ""carried interest"" for the rich."
@jackivinson @ChuckNellis He's vowed to appoint conservatives to the Supreme Court.  Fairly conservative on abortion.  Tax reform.
@ChuckNellis Trump meets William F. Buckley's requirement as the most conservative candidate who can win.
