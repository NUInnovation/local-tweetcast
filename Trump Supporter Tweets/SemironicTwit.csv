"@RichardBSpencer @JimWebbUSA Prefer Sessions. Webb might bring blue collar and patriotic dems, but Trump already has that market cornered."
@rolyatkcinmai That's a very classy way to admit you've lost an argument.

"@nabear17 @G6throughF5  Then explain the concept of ""white privilege""."
@Fobwashed You started this conversation by suggesting Trump's immigration policies are racist. Compared to what ? is my question.

"When you say ""we"" do you mean the voices in your head? The American people will overwhelmingly support Trump in Nov. https://t.co/nSa9w1gOgO"
Like OMG it's 2016! And you. Just. Can't. Even. https://t.co/d6w4yc1Fm8
@Fobwashed Your position is: It's only racist when White countries do it.
"@Fobwashed ...You would never call a nonwhite country ""racist"" for having/enacting policies that are less tolerant than Trump's"
@Fobwashed Deal with the facts. I never said you weren't American. I said you're a hypocrite because you only call out pro-white policies...

@Fobwashed What's really sad is those who conditioned you to think this way didn't bother teaching you about your own culture and policies.
"@Fobwashed For the record, Trump's proposed immigration policies are actually far more lenient than Korea's or Mexico's..."
"@marylovefreedom These days, being called ""bigot"" means you've just won the argument."
@Fobwashed  Your opinion summarized: Mr Trump is racist for proposing an immigration policy that is exactly my ancestral homeland's
"@mathewclute @Fobwashed Perhaps you're too busy being disingenuous to notice, Europeans will be a minority in Europe in 20 years or less."
@Fobwashed ...And this what makes you racist. But racism against whites is socially acceptable in your crowd.
"@Fobwashed Is Korea's immigration policy racist? Mexico's?
Funny how you only see these things as racist when white countries do it..."
"If you're feeling sick you should see the Shaman, he may have some bitter root for your tummy ache. https://t.co/5E7kQa6Y8N"
@Fobwashed If you get sick of white people you can return to your ethnically homogeneous homeland. A luxury whites no longer have. Anywhere.
