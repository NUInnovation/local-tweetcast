@keith_camic legal immigrants like Trump bc he's being a better economy back. Illegals don't like Trump bc they'll be deported.
Yes &amp; that's the parents' fault. They're probably illegal afraid the gravy train is coming to an end. 🚂🚂🚂 https://t.co/94TrMOWGJ0
@sheila06942158 @TheJuanWilliams @realDonaldTrump amazing how much tedifiles &amp; journalists hate him but that makes me like him even more
@sheila06942158 @TheJuanWilliams @realDonaldTrump he was shameful tonight. Like I said a lot of ppl have trashed their cred during election.
@EternaFreeda @benshapiro and that's why I block them.
@EternaFreeda @benshapiro hilarious. Apparently you're clueless what the discussion was about. As for fascist Cruz ppl are nasty.
@reshas @benshapiro @EternaFreeda your man is eliminated. Deal with it.
@reshas @benshapiro @EternaFreeda Heidi I think you are more like the left. Delusional.
@TheJuanWilliams @realDonaldTrump they are PRETENDING to protest but when asked by reporters they're clueless. Get a grip.
@TheJuanWilliams @realDonaldTrump I am a historian specializing in 60s movements. These ppl aren't protestors they are RIOTERS to destroy!
.@TheJuanWilliams shocked you think @realDonaldTrump condoned the violence by  whacky left. These ppl R nothing close to 60s.nowhere close!
@MavisMiter @benshapiro @adagioforstring we're only scary bc we expose the establishment's BS.
I stand with Kate Hoey &amp; the UK getting their control back from EU! They have every right to regain their sovereignty. 🇬🇧🇺🇸 stand w/UK
@sp_who2 @benshapiro like your avatar Taylor.
.@BretBaier thanks for having Kate Hoey from Parliament on your show. See the UK isn't into the globalist BS either.
It's very embarrassing both for @JohnKasich &amp; @GOP. He's also making a mockery of our election system. Exposing dirt https://t.co/ER3G9FpYTK
He blatantly stands there &amp; lies by omission &amp; misinformation then wonders why he's losing. Who knew?! 🙀🙀🙀🙀 https://t.co/4WuFX1dPi1
Teddy's a lawyer he know there is no statute of limitations for murder.  https://t.co/UbMiSF7D62
Of course hell debt it. Oswald was a professed communist &amp; then turned assassin.  https://t.co/UbMiSF7D62
@bumperlaurie2 @SMW5683 you've got that right. He also steals from Trump's platform then calls it his own.
@christinaLW28 @benshapiro agreed.
@christinaLW28 I've see many trash their careers during this election. It's truly sad. Ideology over practicality. @benshapiro
Agreed. It's really sad.  https://t.co/2wXi2oQSM9
@christinaLW28 @benshapiro had upmost respect 4 his work prior to election but now everything's dripped in disdain I question  credibility.

@christinaLW28 @benshapiro one of the girls said Shapiro's portrayal of republican hate was why they did it.
@christinaLW28 @benshapiro two weeks after his visit two black girls put a lynching drawing on a whiteboard in library.
@christinaLW28 @benshapiro he's got to stop bashing Trump. When he came to my university I sat there watching him do it to college students.
@DrMartyFox @jjauthor @hanktastic1776 @seanhannity @TIMENOUT wow. That's very sad.
Isn't Gawker bankrupt yet?  https://t.co/egkrZHgQ3N
"@benshapiro you've been condescending and hawkishly snarky. If you put it out there, you will get same in return. Life. Deal w/it."
@benshapiro the victim card only works for women &amp; not always as you saw w/your little friend Fields. Please quite playing the baby violin.
@christinaLW28 @benshapiro he wasn't ganged up on without provocation. He beats up Trump voters with insults.  guff he gets he's asked for

@sheila06942158 @newtgingrich it's a shame. But he has a lot to offer in spite of the baggage. Couldn't have as much as FDR.
@newtgingrich would love to see you as his VP. You two working together would be amazing.
@KayeMarcy @benshapiro his zeal screams paid hack.
@KayeMarcy @benshapiro you don't have two ppl more against Trump than those two. Even @GeorgeWill doesn't bash voters like Ben does.
@KayeMarcy @benshapiro you don't see @KarlRove or @krauthammer on Twitter bashing Trump voters.
@KayeMarcy @benshapiro Ben has been way too over the top against Trump not to indicate some pay to play deal.
@KayeMarcy @benshapiro Ben is not a political commentator like Hannity or Coultier. But even they would be in trouble if the participated.
@KayeMarcy @benshapiro in all fairness  article doesn't outright name but shills way 2 much 4 journalist.not a commentator i.e. Hannity.
Can't say this is surprising.  https://t.co/ouEI5VDJcb
.@601DvlDog @benshapiro @wespratt95 it's so disappointing when ppl disgrace the uniform. Oh well.
@601DvlDog @benshapiro @wespratt95 whatever. If you are a marine then you know what stand down means.
@thunderup100 @benshapiro but she did admit he's an immigrant. And the Tedophiles yammer on about the Constitution.
@601DvlDog @benshapiro excuse me? I think you'd better check yourself Loretta. You can stand down.
@eurekajimbob @benshapiro why don't you investigate what I'm talking about instead of doing the Obama rush to judgment. Oh well. Bye.
@unaccounted_4 @benshapiro too bad. Cute dog though.
@unaccounted_4 @benshapiro dumb comment but thanks now I can block you.
@Nightbob3 @benshapiro   Ever notice Cruz ppl have less than 10 followers. Can't imagine why.
@Vs20161 @benshapiro he doesn't have the balls to ask me anything.
@mmoore229 @benshapiro @realDonaldTrump sorry Chicky. You can't sedate the things you hate.
@dhohbach @benshapiro obvious you didn't read the link. https://t.co/j4VKVZhR3N
@SeanOCasey1 @benshapiro oh they're screwing Bernie voters too.
@wespratt95 @benshapiro he should to prison for payola. taking campaign $ illegally 2 shill 4 a candidate w/o stating paid endorsement.
@benshapiro best thing about rattling Ben's chains is I find more Tedophiles to block.
@BlackSlug @wespratt95 @benshapiro Ben's not with Breitbart he threw his pissy &amp; quit over pro victim fields.
@tylerhenshaw21 @benshapiro whatever.
@benshapiro you're immature. And if you've had anything to do w/the big $8M payoff you're toast. Don't drop the soap sister.
@benshapiro you made a huge fool of yourself fighting with a millennial which you are barely beyond mental age wise. Arguing with her.
@benshapiro sad thing is I used to read everything u wrote. Thought u were a pretty smart cookie. Now. Watching fight w/teenagers was sad.
@neoconfederate1 @benshapiro whose being a baiter?
@eeeagles @TrumpLegal @benshapiro Cruz is a globalist. Sorry but it's fact.
@CarmTrop @benshapiro I'm more conservative than u could ever imagine.don't support globalists seeking 2 destiny the country &amp; Constitution
"@DarkKnight8814 @benshapiro and Ben, lying for Fields is against the law as well it's called accessory!"
@wespratt95 @benshapiro there's the link. And I thought of young Benny when I read it. Why else would he participate in Fields scam.
@wespratt95 @benshapiro https://t.co/j4VKVZhR3N
@randydeabay @benshapiro right. Sure it is. Idiot.
@linedoggy @benshapiro your boy is losing. Check attitude at the door.
@benshapiro the election has exposed a lot of scammers against the American ppl. Oh and fighting an 18 year old girl at my college? classy.
@benshapiro Ben's got more balls than brains. FCC doesn't like the payola system
"@benshapiro the minute I read the article, I thought of you."
@benshapiro don't believe me? There ya go. https://t.co/j4VKVZhR3N
@benshapiro that's a fact Ben. You're just going to have to deal with it.
@benshapiro if you're part of it like I suspect you are you will be jailed and fined.
@benshapiro enjoy prison.
"@benshapiro well if you've been receiving $ from the Cruz pac like your buddies which I suspect you are, your whole world is about to go FCC"
@BillHemmer @ABC @OutnumberedFNC just quoted 996 number too. Is anyone working at @FoxNews?
@pecanpitt @tedcruz @JudgeJudy I was joking Pecan. Playing on the fact that Ted's an opportunist who would exploit any angle.
This number will be substantially higher by November. @realDonaldTrump is a much more popular guy than most admit.  https://t.co/iAHe56sy0T
@BillHemmer @ABC this has been reported ALL weekend from all the other cable and network news. @FoxNews is spreading false info again!
@BillHemmer @ABC is it really that hard for @FoxNews get the facts straight BEFORE you get on air?
@BillHemmer the delegate count is Trump 1002. As per @ABC last Friday. Why are you reporting the old number? https://t.co/E0ntadvCvc
Many states have voters willing to sue. #Missouri delegates better consider this bc they can &amp; will be sued individually.

@CLewandowski_ more games. #katie was warned yesterday she's playing with fire.

@FlanaganSiobhan @c5hardtop1999 @DrMartyFox @tedcruz @POTUS @lawiegers nope not so. Ted is a globalist. Merge with mex &amp; Canada
Cruz got money from Soros so I am a bit perplexed why you'd post this image.  https://t.co/K4mz2X3xbl
NOTE: both @ALSHARPTON_REV &amp; Jackson have turned against Trump. Al even said he'd leave the country.  https://t.co/K4mz2X3xbl
