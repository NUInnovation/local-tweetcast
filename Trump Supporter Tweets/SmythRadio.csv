@mimi_parlak You need to follow the thread. YOU were the one who was slightly off topic. I am trying to steer u back on topic.
@mimi_parlak His tax plan is a move to the right of where we are and I don't believe reports that he is lying about anything.
"@mimi_parlak if you understood the Conservative ideology, you would see he hasn't really strayed much off principle @MrAm29862548"
"@mimi_parlak I defended him perfectly. I challenged all of you fake conservatives what part of Trump's positions is NOT ""conservative""."
@DannyBritton256 @SalesHarrington Christine said he stated he wants to raise the minimum wage. That's one of her many lies.

@Genius_Parks He was a businessman playing competing on a level playing field. It's not like he was a politician doing this stuff.
@Genius_Parks All I can say is I believe Trumps pro-life story. Mine is very similar.
@Genius_Parks I used to be a liberal so I can relate to having liberal views in my past contradicting current ideology.
@Genius_Parks Anecdotal. So the cameras caught one pissed off guy. So what. There are illegal Mexicans rioting Trump in American streets
"@Genius_Parks Nobody except NYTimes employees know what's on tape, I heard..."
@Genius_Parks I can only agree with you on the court here. SCOTUS I presume...
@Genius_Parks I think they both have very good economic plans. So there is no problems from me there.
@Genius_Parks Name something in the Trump platform that requires you to give up reason.
"@Genius_Parks He didn't attack Cruz, he just concluded Cruz was lying and said it. How is that an attack?"
"@Genius_Parks I like Cruz's flat tax, in fact I think anything other than flat is unconstitutional. But there is more to prez than tax plan."
@Genius_Parks Did you not see the Mexicans rioting Trump in Orange County? Trump ppl stayed away from it.
"@Genius_Parks And after all the racism of the past 8 years of Obama administration, you're nit picking what Trumpsters are doing/saying?"
@Genius_Parks That's BS. I have Hispanic family members and a Hispanic lady as a a Trump volunteer. We aren't prejudice. Maybe some.
@Genius_Parks He said he wants to eliminate the Department of Education.
