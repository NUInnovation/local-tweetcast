@slone @gppart that's great because Cruz was never ever NEVER going to be considered for VP. Not w/a questionable birth cert😆
@swebs if we are dependent we are controlled.
@tonyzump it was incredible actually. Even Orlando went overwhelmingly for Trump. Quite a phenomenon.
@tonyzump in Fla alone the majority of women voted for Trump.
@Ricky_Vaughn99 @CraazzyKarl https://t.co/ZMUAZwggNa
@tonyzump Hispanics loathe him. I live in Fla. They were overwhelmingly against him. Miami is where CAIR is headquartered. That's all he won
@tonyzump I doubt he would risk losing 1/2 his base by suddenly supporting little Rubio &amp; his amnesty debacle. Even FOR the delegates.
@pwnz0r3d @Ricky_Vaughn99 @CraazzyKarl 1/2 my family is still in Israel. I'm correct jackass. 😆
@Ricky_Vaughn99 @CraazzyKarl the non religious probably do but true orthodox rabbis would never. The flock does what it's told.
@Ricky_Vaughn99 @CraazzyKarl im Jewish. That's exactly how it is Ricky. Those in the Levitical tribe (rabbis) are forbidden by Torah to vote
"@tonyzump the difference is, it's respectable disagreeing. Intelligent &amp; well thought out. That's rare. I appreciate that."
@streetglide12 @LyndaG1963 @NekoArc @lukiOC @virleehol ROFLMAO!
@tonyzump LOL. ❤️ I'm glad. I enjoy our differences.
@tonyzump that can't happen. His amnesty screw up prevents him from being chosen. He's too polarizing. Could have been good tho.
Hey @Reince Listen carefully.  https://t.co/aXAkYnZe7V
@Ricky_Vaughn99 @CraazzyKarl FYI. Rabbis &amp; their families don't vote. It's forbidden in the Torah. Even if you're in Yeshiva you can't vote😆
@mparkertng that was @Reince 's plan. He infected the party with liberals. It's his only success.
What is it with Progressives &amp; killing jobs? Why don't they ever want anyone gainfully employed? #Trump2016  https://t.co/gDsf66ATJL
@Chiefchuck24 @jko417 @CarmineZozzora @Cory_1077 @healthandcents im sure a jerk was involved. Just not a knee jerk. 🙄

@MuncTomm @sparksburns @LindseyGrahamSC I don't know. Fox seems to enjoy slathering us with idiots. It's their new venue
@mitchellvii @SurfPHX I doubt he would have contained himself reading the Corker Bill!

@xertx3 @TEN_GOP yes. We are happy to help you too.

@LaFalangeNueva @NekoArc @LyndaG1963 @virleehol @lukiOC I've never been a victim in my entire life😊
@virleehol @NekoArc @DDwarf51 @LyndaG1963 @lukiOC Yes it does. I'm sorry that happened to you.
@NekoArc @virleehol @DDwarf51 @LyndaG1963 @lukiOC you're boring now hon. See ya! 😆😆😆😆😆
@NekoArc @virleehol @DDwarf51 @LyndaG1963 @lukiOC EVEN the animal kingdom understands male &amp; female. Lions don't accidentally mount males. 😆
@NekoArc @virleehol @DDwarf51 @LyndaG1963 @lukiOC Even atheists know a penis makes you a man and a vagina makes you a female. Try again. 😆
@orion99da @Donald4Change many people got duped by that little liberal bastard. REINCE infested the party with them.
@LyndaG1963 @NekoArc @virleehol @lukiOC I AM a professional &amp; so is my husband. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
@virleehol @NekoArc @DDwarf51 @LyndaG1963 @lukiOC my kids would laugh their asses off frankly. ESP if they tried to push this BS on them.
@virleehol @DDwarf51 @NekoArc @LyndaG1963 @lukiOC just because you feel a certain way doesn't make it real. That's life.
@virleehol @DDwarf51 @NekoArc @LyndaG1963 @lukiOC what people deserve honey bunches is TRUTH! Always TRUTH.
@NekoArc @virleehol @DDwarf51 @LyndaG1963 @lukiOC what does deserving have to do with anything. Genetics are deaf &amp; blind.
@DDwarf51 @NekoArc @LyndaG1963 @lukiOC @virleehol HOW DO ORGANS equate to bigotry? 😬😬 #Hilarious
@MAGA_1958 @mavrick803 @SpeakerRyan @SenTedCruz im armed so im not worried. It's the LIBATARDS who have to fear.
@virleehol @NekoArc @LyndaG1963 @lukiOC growing up requires knowing if your genetics get you pregnant OR make someone pregnant FIRST😆
@NekoArc @virleehol @LyndaG1963 @lukiOC calling me a bigot doesn't change my knowledge of anatomy. Vaginas &amp; penises are always neutral.
@virleehol @NekoArc @LyndaG1963 @lukiOC im not talking to you hon.

"@NekoArc @virleehol @LyndaG1963 @lukiOC um, YES. In health care we don't get to lie to folks. We need to tell you if you have a vagina 😆"
@LyndaG1963 @NekoArc @lukiOC @virleehol but it's YOUR FAULT Lyda. You created ovaries testicles and the uterus in that lab in your garage
@LyndaG1963 @NekoArc @lukiOC @virleehol it's not hard! 😆😆😆😆 our hormones agree.No matter how you carve the body w/o hormones you revert back
@NekoArc @LyndaG1963 @lukiOC @virleehol the fact you believe such utter nonsense makes me fear you have a brain tumor which CAN be fixed👍🏽
@NekoArc @LyndaG1963 @lukiOC @virleehol im not a bigot. Science is science. Intersex people still have a dominate hormone trait. Sorry. 😂
@virleehol @NekoArc @lukiOC @LyndaG1963 it's not even average. It's anatomy &amp; physiology. It's like arguing your dog could be a butterfly😂
@LyndaG1963 @NekoArc @lukiOC @virleehol @a219224 @GoalieBill328 @sawmilltaters No! Please! Let them be! They are comedic relief! 😂😂😊
@NekoArc @lukiOC @virleehol @LyndaG1963 UM. Yes they do. Even hermaphrodites have a specific genital configuration. Take anatomy. 😆
Dear CruzBots. Im NOT a CRUZBOT. Even if I was I wouldnt be NOW b/c Cruz lost😊He's a loser😋He was born a loser😊STOP following me#BlessYour❤️

@CLIFFBELL888 @keywestcliff2 @mitchellvii @republic2016 @adam041590 @Women4Trump @fooschamp95 I wanted to forget that. Thanks so much😁

@Women4Trump @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump she did a lot more than support a war. She kept the animals in check. Know what I mean?
@Women4Trump @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump we will see. Frankly Condi would be the best thing to happen to him. She's an amazing woman

@lorettatheprole @gabeschoenfeld Clinton was promised her sec of state position to drop out. She handed him the WH as much as Mitt did.
@lorettatheprole @gabeschoenfeld Obama got in b/c NO ONE wanted the 1st 1/2 black POTUS to serve 1 term. It would have been rude.
@lorettatheprole @gabeschoenfeld I agree. Clintons numbers are fabricated bullshit. She's the weakest DNC candidate in history.
