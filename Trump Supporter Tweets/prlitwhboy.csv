@FoxNews @DLoesch @realDonaldTrump untruthful spin by Loesh. Fox - Get someone who is credible to speak on the election please.
@seanhannity These PA GOP ballots are evidence of blatant corruption! Misleading and deceptive tactics which is a poor example for our youth
"@seanhannity @JohnKasich and @tedcruz alliance is a desperate,tactic of losing candidates.Not reflective of a leader. Go @realDonaldTrump!"

@FoxNews @stephenfhayes @realDonaldTrump such subtle &amp; sometimes overt bias against GOP presumptive candidate.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump will bring out many voters from the silent masses. These polls meaningless at this time.

@realDonaldTrump this is corrupt and needs to change! Thank-you for exposing this unfair system!
@realDonaldTrump A disgrace to our country! A far cry from a democracy!!
"@greta however you are great Greta! A true journalist - fair, objective, unbiased!"

"@seanhannity one of the best talk radio and TV shows. Informative, fair, intelligent,"
@realDonaldTrump @megynkelly @AC360 She's already lost millions b/c Trump followers won't watch her. Overtly biased! FX boss' little darling
@realDonaldTrump @megynkelly What's she going to do for guests when you're President? We've stopped watching her show long ago - one sided.
@realDonaldTrump more of this and less of the other! Go Trump!
@loudobbsnews GOP out of touch and time for change.
@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump is resilient tough leader who can take constant hits  from all sides &amp; stay the course.
@AnnCoulter Gloves came off during @realDonaldTrump interview. Concurrently being hit on all cable networks except Fox business now.
@realDonaldTrump we are bored w GOP debates. Next debate Trump vs Clinton
"@loudobbsnews If voice of people not respected by uniting w @realDonaldTrump, GOP will fracture &amp; new conservative party will be established"
"@realDonaldTrump had the vision, courage  &amp; foresight to identify the danger before us. Traits of true leader!"
@loudobbsnews @politico if @realDonaldTrump delegates pledged to another the people's trust gone &amp; end of Rep party!
@realDonaldTrump We need strong leader to protect US from immigration chaos happening in Germany. Disastor there - not reported in media.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews These polls have too small of sample size to be accurate. Are these polls considering ind &amp; Reagon Dem vote?
@41jellis @greta why the escalation of attacks recently? Sobering
@FoxNews @oreillyfactor @foxnewspoll @SenSanders @realDonaldTrump The sample size is much too small to be accurate.
@AnnCoulter Luntz focus groups useless - statistically irrelevant.
@seanhannity contested convention will hurt the GOP
@JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump was right to skip the debate. Not a good deal. Fox didn't treat him fairly last time! Go Trump!
@seanhannity THANK-YOU for your unbiased show. All shows on every network biased against @realDonaldTrump the hr before.
"@realDonaldTrump @loudobbsnews  did great reporting tonight following the $ to Cruz, Kasich &amp; Rubio"

@JudgeJeanine thank-you again for articulating the conversations &amp; thoughts of many @realDonaldTrump voters!
@loudobbsnews recent desperate measures from all sides against @realDonaldTrump are incredulous! Hoping the casual voter not deceived.

@JudgeJeanine @EricTrump @FoxNews How is Trump campaign handling attacks and lies from all directions? Be encouraged by support of millions
@loudobbsnews @realDonaldTrump Feels good for this retired blue collar worker and vet to have a voice again! Go TRUMP!
@loudobbsnews @realDonaldTrump unbelievable  comments by Kasich &amp; Rubio. This rhetoric solidifying support &amp; votes 4 Trump.

@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump The voters can see through the deception! Go Trump!
@JudgeJeanine @FoxNews they just don't get it - in denial. Glad you get it Judge.
@loudobbsnews this is one big reason why voters supporting @realDonaldTrump
@FoxNews @PollsterPatrick Or could it be that these states were closed to Independents and were caucus states.
@greta @GOP @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews NO - DT will have major crossover appeal from all demographics &amp; Bernie supporters.
@realDonaldTrump Good clarification of Trump U! Why didn't @FoxNews also report?
