@tonerockpr get off the plantation bruh. Trump is about real economic empowerment not government dependence https://t.co/SINEdXniAl
👇🏾👇🏾👇🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 https://t.co/rxQTyIIxIT
"@tonerockpr can't respond to hear say but there's proof that he employs22,450 legal employees. That's 22,450 more jobs created by HRC"
@tonerockpr where's the facts? I guarantee that is false
@tonerockpr do you have the facts on this?
@tonerockpr she makes her $ by making speeches. Trump does economic development which has a multiplier effect. His tax plan does the same
"@tonerockpr and she shouldn't because there's not much to brag about. She hasn't helped anyone. Trump employs 22,450 Americans with his $"
@tonerockpr neither did Hillary
@tonerockpr not degrading them just challenging them to dream big! Something wrong with that? I got fam who have been on the system 30+yrs👎🏾
@tonerockpr get off the plantation we be free 😂😂
@tonerockpr dream big bro. Dream big
@tonerockpr you yeah you and all the Dems
@tonerockpr  😂 funny man. I have reasons for staying anonymous that might be way above your head little guy minimum wage guy 😂
@tonerockpr #phonyhillary called at risk black youth #superpredators let that sink in. She's like the plantation owners wife!
@tonerockpr as a black man I'm interested in big opportunities not minimum wage. U should be ashamed for supporting #phonyhillary
@tonerockpr nah I don't agree with everything trump says/does but he's best 4 Isis&amp; economic crisis &amp;economic development
@tonerockpr can't believe u said something about values.
@tonerockpr values? Hillary wants to kill babies abortion. She's for open borders putting us in danger with illegals &amp; Isis infiltration
@tonerockpr https://t.co/9Bmh0Mv3wB
@tonerockpr lol trump knows exactly what he's doing.His intuition and judgment is way better than #CrookedHillary the phony sniper fire liar
@KellyannePolls will you be helping @realDonaldTrump get elected?? #TrumpTrain
