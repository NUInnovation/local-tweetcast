@LouDobbs @WSJ He's worried about HIS election. RINO on the way OUT. #KellyWard
"BREAKING: Trump-Hating Ryan Goes too Far, Gets Huge Bad News From Home&amp;#8230; Is He Finished? https://t.co/tWagOanSIO"
@Veteran4Trump @immigrant4trump Amen to that!
@SenJohnMcCain I anxiously await primary day and voting for @kelliwardaz. GOPe RINOs must go!
@pnehlen @uniquelady1245 Ryan is due to be #Cantorized.
WOAH: Trey Gowdy Exposes Ted Cruz's Campaign Tactics... Justice Has Been SERVED https://t.co/pGmZO7yndN via @Truth_Division
@watchdoggy @MooiachiRios The MSM and Obama share the same agenda. Trump is anathema to them.
BREAKING: Donald Trump Just Announced His Pick for Attorney General â€“ Hillaryâ€™s Worst Nightmare! https://t.co/MiLv8w77FJ
@KarlTPF @kelliwardaz He is justly worried about losing his election. Adios John!
@WalshFreedom @ReignsFreedom The VOTERS set the standards.
It's up to the GOPe to ADAPT to the voter's will. Government is the SERVANT of the people. Government is not the MASTER. Understand?
"@brithume @LuvMyAmerica No one with any sense believed them. This ""deal"" was forced on us just like ""Obamacare""."
@grindingdude This shit has gone FAR enough! VOTE TRUMP!!
@pastorbrianrobe @jkc_jaycee I've lost whatever little respect I had for them.
@tomtomokie AMEN!!!
@PatDollard @SpreadButter GOPe is scared. They should be. ðŸ˜Ž
@DrMichaelSchwa4 Amen to that!
@jmdonsi @Gelicmonk Yup
@BlueThunder808 @immigrant4trump Men like them destroyed the GOP.
"@WayneDupreeShow @tomtomokie Why would #Trump even want an endorsement from the Globalist ""gentlemen""."
@ThankYouDonald I thought Jeb Shrub signed a PLEDGE.
@agreatercountry @LuvMyAmerica @realDonaldTrump ONE of the reasons they are OUT!
@trump2016fan @Cottontop73 @pnehlen @AnnCoulter Voters have shown what they think of those principles. #TrumpTrain!
@sjh2222 @bfraser747 @blaubok @pnehlen He needs to go out and earn a living.
@LindaSuhler @Phatzs2 Canada or the USA?
"@FoxBusiness @MooiachiRios @KatrinaPierson @realDonaldTrump The ""Shrubs"" and their Globalism have been REJECTED. That's Life!"
"Butt Hurt Neo Cons won't support Trump. Well, the voters chose #Trump OVER the Butt Hurt Neo Cons. Bon Voyage Losers!!"
@steph93065 @LindaSuhler @realDonaldTrump @CalFreedomMom @CarmineZozzora @Braveheart_USA @Stonewall_77  Amen! https://t.co/vsaw1vee3F
"@DRUDGE_REPORT @SharonWilcox13 Great! Not ""Butt Hurt"" like the Shrub family. This is good."

@baaron2871 @Cookiebruno @jjnormandin @rescuetracker81 @_Proud_American @seanhannity They must be elected. RESEARCH your votes!!
@Cookiebruno @baaron2871 @jjnormandin @rescuetracker81 @_Proud_American @seanhannity That's NOT what it says. Re read it.
@1ubet @RSBNetwork The article is a LIE.
@Duxgirl27 @1ubet @nytpolitics He said he wanted BETTER jobs that paid MORE than minimum. Ya still EARN your pay.
@1ubet @nytpolitics I heard the interview. The article is crap.
"@Ron_Christie @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump Your ""standards"" have been REJECTED by the voters. Time for YOU to adjust to ours. Understand?"
@ProblemPanacea @tomtomokie Whores?
@glennbeck Cruz lost. Live with it. Want a Cheeto?
@pegcamp78 He may NOT even be in office come January.
"@SharonWilcox13 The ""Shrubs"" are Globalists."
@ImagineAnna @Rubberblon @HillaryClinton That WILL be good!
@ProgsToday Human life is nothing to experiment with.
@fubaglady @baaron2871 #Trump continually said that the Dems would come after him on this. Suggested getting a declaratory judgement.
@BreitbartNews We are being ROBBED of our culture!
@mitchellvii @jkc_jaycee That is just insanity.
@theblaze Globalist trash. GLAD they are gone.
"@slone @PCsReasy Remember that 1st debate with Megyn Kelley? Yes, Trump was a target!"
"@costareports @tomtomokie They are 2 of the reasons I left the GOP years ago. I read daddy's lips and I remember the ""Patriot"" act."
@JaredWyand @ILSenDems They don't respect our Constitution or country.
@ludy730 @glennbeck Good luck in the future and hold out hope for OUR Supreme Court. I'm REALLY concerned of the court's future.
"@glennbeck Glenn, Will you support Hillary or Trump? Those are our choices."
@RWNutjob1 @KayAdamsB That's CLASSIC!! They must be bored with the weather. ;-)
@glennbeck Will you support Trump or Hillary?
@owenwardsr @PaulaPaulacamp @JohnKasich @realDonaldTrump He really didn't pave anything. He is just avoiding getting crushed.
@mrstutt @umpire43 @mlong42947 Absolutely.
@WayneDupreeShow @Gelicmonk I thought the original source was the' Warren Report'.
@mparkertng Can't afford the dry cleaning bill.
Ben Carson to head VP selection committee. Per Fox.
Funny how that works. https://t.co/HtwMDu8P2a

@jaybakeraz Fox has it on screen!
"HOORAAAAYYYYYYY!!!!

@greta Ted is in denial AND delusional!
@GarrettVentry @shortman5427 Not at all.
@Brainykid2010 @JohnKasich Amen to that.
ABSOLUTELY!! https://t.co/qIt3E2CCao
@greta @loadnup @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Cruz will remain in denial.
@marklevinshow Told ya Cruz would LOSE.
@blazinbling91 @PaineThomas1737 @MamaBear4Cruz @JRobertSmith1 @army1man1 @YodaLoco @TriciaNC1 @jend0315 @handley_dix Cry and whine.
@BOSSYtxmar55 @KayAdamsB The guy snapped. Oh well...
Yup https://t.co/JRDbXHXLCe
"@StacyHovis @DailyCaller Yup, it's called 'weather'. Ya can't change the weather."
"If campaign pressure got #Cruz to SNAP, HOW we he cope with being President? Too weak for the job?? He didn't look good yesterday."
@Bikers4Trump @Husker4Trump @tedcruz He's a lawyer and knows the law. ;-)
@IngrahamAngle @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Honorable is a good thing. Is Hillary honorable?
@dkm177 Financial pressure.
@marklevinshow Was there any photographic evidence?
@mrntweet He's a lawyer.
"@launch4success @MOVEFORWARDHUGE @KamVTV Oh heck, watch MEGYN cry!! :-)"
@marklevinshow Cruz will be eviscerated when the polls close. Cruz WILL lose. ;-)
@BoudicaRides @Barkley4Bernie @Morning_Joe @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Exactly.
@Barkley4Bernie @BoudicaRides @Morning_Joe @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Idiots do that?
"@Morning_Joe @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Cruz SOUGHT confrontation. He wants to play a ""victim"" role?"
I affirm. https://t.co/SUvtytYcaq
@KNP2BP @KayAdamsB Bon Voyage!!
"@BigStick2013 @KayAdamsB His ""suicide"" was supporting Cruz."
Will say anything to... https://t.co/58lcz142A4
Huge WIN!! https://t.co/5kiImUvH6X
@marklevinshow Cruz will lose. Just watch
@stranahan @BreitbartNews Good is winning by a landslide! Cheer up Glenn.
@mile_hi_33 @jorgeramosnews Cowardly behavior.
"@tedcruz Ted, try SELF FUNDING!!"
"@tedcruz Nope, not gunna."
"@toddgillman @StarryKnight47 @tedcruz Watch a loser, why?"
@tedcruz Rubio bowed out with some class.
@catblackfrazier @tedcruz @CarlyFiorina Did she fall off the stage again?
@marklevinshow What PAC is buying it?
"@tedcruz Release SEALED records. File NE lawsuit. Then talk to us. In other words, GO AWAY Ted."
@gurbsr @win_az16 Amen to that! I even voted for the DEM last time. Only time in my life. Been SICK of McCain for a LONG time.
Seen nothing of Kasich today. He finally give up?
@Maggie1715 @tedcruz @indystar Cruz is DONE. Put a fork in it.
@glennbeck Want nothing to do with Glenn Beck.
"@EasybillBuc @MarieSganga @Cher_SD Government has NO business in ""Legal Behavior"" control."
What happens if a USA tourist doesn't have their PAPERS in Mexico?
Mexico requires a Visa to even visit. I quit visiting. https://t.co/wy3LdRv0Mw
@marklevinshow I'll be watching something else. I've written you off. Don't even hear your radio show anymore.
#Cruz is a double talking lawyer. We need the straight shooting businessman. Just Sayin'.
@NBCNewsVideo @LuvMyAmerica @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Cruz DEFLECTS from the issue. Lawyers are trained AND paid to do that. DT is a biz man
@tedcruz Horse Dump!!
Trump will CLIMB in the polls. Americans WANT CHANGE for the better. No doubt about it. https://t.co/ZU6b0woYsT
@tedcruz I only WISH my kid was repeating the words of #DonaldTrump. Is that clear enough? SHOW your SEALED records.
@dmorrow1125 @PCsReasy Never seen it. Likely never will.
@JimForbes_Pasco @win_az16 @kelliwardaz McCain needs to go. He helped me to abandon the GOP. Bushes had a bit to do with it too. Ciao John.
@survivinglife3 @PaulaPaulacamp Has @TedCruz seen and paid attention to this? He should. Carly might want to give a look also. CruzBots? ;-)
@Sheepdogleader @pegcamp78 @PaulaPaulacamp And they are BOTH getting away with it. Something is TERRIBLY wrong!!
@PaulaPaulacamp The loser is ALWAYS asking for money! Maybe he should get a JOB.
What will Kasich say?? What will Crud say?? :-) https://t.co/eEFCCBA191
@SCOOPNJ78 @STRONG_OPED @FoxNews @tedcruz STFU? What about free speech?
@pegcamp78 @PaulaPaulacamp A natural born citizen with SEALED birth records. WTF???
