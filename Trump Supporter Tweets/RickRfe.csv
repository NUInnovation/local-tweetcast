@non1amato @drbeachgirl07 @diabaguette Your nephew although gallant was a pawn of the gross lies of the Bush Regime. WOMD's were nowhere!
@drbeachgirl07 @diabaguette @non1amato Of Course.  It happens to be fact.
@drbeachgirl07 @diabaguette @non1amato The Bushes represent Trade deals that don't work? Fighting wars people don't understand or support?
"@drbeachgirl07 @DiamondandSilkThe Bushes, Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham &amp;John McCain don’t represent anyone other than their donors."
"What is wrong with Ryan? This Republican party has finally been  exposed. And the blame goes to the Republican  ""elite""."
Top10 Trump haters 1Larry Odonell 2Chris Mathews 3Rove 4Krauthamer 5OReilley 6Maddow 7Chris Hayes 8MegynKelly 9ChuckTodd 10AndersonCooper
What's wrong with Lindsay Graham.  Always negative and He doesn't like anyone.  A seriously negative person.  Someone voted for him?
Karl Rove Has No Life In Him. He’s Resigned to the Fact He’s Been 100% Wrong Yet AGAIN and he has lost all Credibility
Quinnipiac found Clinton’s negative ratings with white men at a stun­ning 72 per­cent.
Trump is building this while Running for president. Meanwhile Obama is giving the wave at a game &amp; Stand up comedy. https://t.co/DnMIMRug3c
What a difference Trump will make! https://t.co/d4ipV7Nqgg
"Fed up with rule of lobbyists and an insular political class, to those who’ve seen their government ignore their Needs Trump offers hope!"
"Trump has initiated a long overdue recognition of parasite capitalism eating
out the life capacities of the US itself."
An historic blunder. That guy is famous! Just killed it. https://t.co/DJjcZ1BHqu
Mathews went Democratic. Had a 4 panel that said you have no chance.  Can't wait until you annihilate Hillary. How Fun! Congrats!
Hey Chris ...Nice biased Democrat show. 4 minions on a panel. Saying Trump has no chance. Be careful.
Chris Mathews is hosting a Trump can't win program.  He is biased&amp; hilarious saying Trump has no chance! Just wait Mathews. You better duck.
Was Cruz an easy target or what? From the incredible joke of Fiorina to his poor father from Cuba who sided with Oswald. On to Killery.
Lowrey is an idiot. He's in Hillarys corner! What a guy errrrrr loser. https://t.co/BRibkJ4fhD
And he has also passed Hillary. There's no stopping Trump.
From not even being natural born to his commy  father and Fiorina who was fired from HP. Who votes for this guy? https://t.co/aKCC87MU8d
Holtz is an awsome endorsement.  Nice job Donald &amp; Crew. https://t.co/kRXTuPaDqX
Keep up the Lying Ted. It is so true. Cruz is a nut case to not understand everyone eventually sees through him. https://t.co/ElFypVfaGx
This is a historic primary. Cruz will be looked at historically as how not to run a campaign.  Especially from such a desperate position.
Why is Cruz so out of touch? Fiorina was fired from HP and a horrible exec. Kasick his colluding teammate doesn't have a matching suit.
Sometimes even Saturday night live can't write this stuff any better. Just hilarious. https://t.co/173YCZxCUd
And he hasn't even started on her negatives. This will rock her just like Jeb Cruz and all the others. https://t.co/8gpImUkVwK
Ted Cruz Campaign Staffers Are Reportedly Beginning to Panic https://t.co/TWWqK5SOfy
Marco Rubio Not About to Endorse a Loser Like Ted Cruz https://t.co/cqFL9YNr97
This guy's credibility is seriously in doubt. https://t.co/7yVtjY7AaA
Voting for a Canadian is throwing your vote away. Cruz supporters should really wake up.
Can't we at least vote American for once!  From Obama the Muslim to now in 2nd place is a Canadian. AMERICANS need to wake up! VOTE TRUMP
Cheating lying it's all true. I mean really? Someone's actually voting for him? https://t.co/EbE35GQsXf
Just rediculous how he is allowed to run for president. His grating on the ears televangelist lying style is gross https://t.co/f2Z0OMBoHK
If you don't get Trump. Mllions do! Our government hasn't protected or said anything of truth for 16 years. Trump tells it like it is.
Cruz with that televangelist style is so phoney and his voice/style is  terribly grating on the ears. What are people thinking?
Look at these people. Mex flags &amp; have no clue. Wanting to turn US into Tijuana. That's why we really need that wall https://t.co/JNsDauQGV5
@drbeachgirl07
@S_tephie_a @RickRfe Legal immigration is fine. What's wrong with making illegals come to the US properly. Where is your logic?
@S_tephie_a @RickRfe so you can understand if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck.  It's a duck.
@S_tephie_a @RickRfe You need to get a grip on how things work. It happens to be first hand knowledge not here say.
@S_tephie_a @RickRfe It's real and concentrated in My City Costa Mesa. Been there 40 years.
@S_tephie_a @RickRfe I know many. They tell me /living with 5 to 10 per apartment. Going  to Hoag hospital for free having their babies.
Indiana’s governor started off endorsement of Ted Cruz with lengthy praise of Donald Trump https://t.co/g8ewRwoPMg via @bi_politics
This is why we need a wall. https://t.co/2TyML1PkMf
The town is riddled w illegals.I live there. Crime everywhere eastside. They even have to barracade common streets. https://t.co/IAyKRsk3Ow
Here's  a guy beaten up by protestor Mexicans Bernies not much said. If a trump guy did this it would be monumental https://t.co/2TyML1PkMf
Always lying. It's disgusting to think anyone votes for him. https://t.co/aS4vCcFMkF
What a joke Cruz and Kasick are. Just terrible people in general.  Messing around with an election Both born losers. https://t.co/9fMAaGfysw
@KTLA You have no idea how many illegals are in CM. Living there the drain on social services is disgusting.
@DRUDGE_REPORT @CBSLA living in CM. The whole Eastside is full of illegals. 5 or 10 per household or apartment. Build the wall fast!
@helgasilvaNOW @breaking @ABC7 CM is full or illegals. They are sent to Mexico and days later return.  I have seen it first hand. From CM.
Trump rally in CM. I live there. It has the utmost need for the wall. Everywhere you go are illegals.
@DonaldJTrumpJr GoTrump. Just met a Sanders delegate from Nevada. The caucus voting situation there was described as chaotic &amp; dishonest
What a joke thinking the failed Fiorina and lackluster Kasick could help. Is Cruz seriously smart at all? Just a joke of a situation there.
