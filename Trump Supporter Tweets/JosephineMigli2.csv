@bpolitics @tedcruz Donald Trump supporters are loyal there's no way in hell we would ever vote for you

@Rene_gadeCowboy @petesmom2 @greta @FoxNews @DanaPerino the only one that's a con man is Cruz
@sisk_jo @stormyweatherz @greta @FoxNews Cruz is like any other politicians he will do absolutely nothing for a country vote Trump
@TANSTAAFL23 @BhawksGo and Ted Cruz is a lousy corrupt disgusting piece of you-know-what
"@weeklystandard @tedcruz , Donald Trump is the only one that can fix this economy"
Instead of trying to stop Trump people better smarten up and try to stop Bernie Sanders before he ends up destroying us
