@Dinos4Trump What hoe?
@frickyfastfall @bill_sketch @Pol4Trump @dontflingpoop @Smitty_breh Hahaha
@bill_sketch @Pol4Trump @frickyfastfall @dontflingpoop @Smitty_breh NO?
@bill_sketch @frickyfastfall @dontflingpoop @Pol4Trump @Smitty_breh OMG.
@Pol4Trump @bill_sketch @frickyfastfall @dontflingpoop @Smitty_breh I hope my father doesn't see this.
"@Pol4Trump @bill_sketch @frickyfastfall @dontflingpoop @Smitty_breh Well, two with yours."
"@Pol4Trump @bill_sketch @frickyfastfall @dontflingpoop @Smitty_breh Lol, I don't think so. Considering that it's only one butthole."
@bill_sketch @Pol4Trump @frickyfastfall @dontflingpoop @Smitty_breh You're terrible! Oh my... but right one.
@bill_sketch @Pol4Trump @frickyfastfall @dontflingpoop @Smitty_breh Hottie.
@KilianMuster Thank you! He surely will.
@frickyfastfall @bill_sketch @dontflingpoop @Pol4Trump @Smitty_breh Lol.
@benshapiro SPOILER ALERT: I'm his wife.
@bill_sketch @dontflingpoop @frickyfastfall @Pol4Trump @Smitty_breh Who is she?
@bill_sketch @dontflingpoop @frickyfastfall @Pol4Trump @Smitty_breh I believe the apostrophe isn't necessary.
@ArthurAngell Shouldn't have said that.
"@ArthurAngell Correct, freedom of speech. I just find it disrespectful, and utterly unethical."
@bill_sketch @dontflingpoop @frickyfastfall @Pol4Trump @Smitty_breh https://t.co/ZqABEX11nf
"@ConsBlondeshell Well, someone should let her know. I have her blocked to avoid future arguments."
"@bill_sketch @dontflingpoop @frickyfastfall @Pol4Trump @Smitty_breh Lol, these are actually pretty funny. I like humor."
"If you want my email, so we can FaceTime tomorrow, feel free to send me a message. Some may have screenshotted it already; it's fine."

"@BltProofDiction Stop, I'm really trying to be nice."
@BltProofDiction Hahaha
@shelby_tfm I'm homeschooled... awkward.
@madeIynpaige I regret everything.
@madeIynpaige Thick is fine. We're all beautiful in our own way. It was just a moment of madness.
"I may have crossed the line by trying to defend myself, and calling an individual overweight. We all make mistakes. My sincere apologies."
I simply told her I would FaceTime her tomorrow to prove I wasn't.
"Anyhow, so I received a Snapchat message of a cat and a fish emoji, and asked why she thought so. She proceeded to call me fake."
@shelby_tfm It doesn't really matter. Lol. There's a good thing about having contacts.
@ubermenschian Jajaja
"@ubermenschian Sí, por favor."
"@ChaboiJoee I know. Funny, right?"
"@ChaboiJoee A girl named Sydney, and Jerry."
@PlebianKnight Maybe.
@frickyfastfall @bill_sketch @dontflingpoop @Pol4Trump @Smitty_breh Lol.
@ConsBlondeshell My sincere apologies to whomever I offended.
"I'm currently at a family dinner, but if you think I'm a catfish, feel free to FaceTime me tomorrow after work: 6:30 PM."
"@ConsBlondeshell Well, I'll take that into consideration next time. Thank you."
@bill_sketch @Pol4Trump @madiee_nicole Yes.
@BrittanyJChapa Blocked.
"@BrittanyJChapa Why are you talking to me? Get out of my mentions, please. #Annoying"
@Volcanic_Surfer My new motto. #GoldenTweet
"@ConsBlondeshell I might have gone a little too far, but she started this."
"@ConsBlondeshell If you only knew what she has been calling me, you'd understand. I'm the type of girl that stands up for myself."
@PlebianKnight Aww... you're so sweet. Thank you!
I'm just ignoring people who try to bring me down from now on.
Mood: https://t.co/ILP9S3XtTP
@Volcanic_Surfer https://t.co/RzGYGLiob2
I've lost my appetite.
@LegallyLatina Same shirt as AVI.
@Volcanic_Surfer https://t.co/8F0rW3NKLG
"@Volcanic_Surfer Lol. Agreed, but enough. We all have imperfections. I'll be the good citizen, and stop this feud. We're all beautiful."
Or they started something with me. Blocked. https://t.co/DpGcQFP20H
@Volcanic_Surfer He had to insult my nostrils. https://t.co/mchboMD3yI
"@ShottestFuck IS IT? LOL, HUSH."
"@madiee_nicole If anything, she's the bully. As a victim, I am entitled to stand up for myself."
"""Someone's trying to insult you by claiming you don't have nostrils. Don't think I've ever heard anyone try that before, pretty sad too."""
@madiee_nicole Please get out of my mentions. Thank you.
"@madiee_nicole Okay. She does, too."
"@madiee_nicole @Pol4Trump I'm not, and vice versa. She started name-calling first. I have the right to defend myself."
@BltProofDiction @jerry_starkey I'm not even mad.
@BltProofDiction @jerry_starkey This is actually funny.
@BooCunningham Okie dokie.
"@jerry_starkey Better than having a hideous nose like yours, so I wouldn't be talking. P.S. Boys still love me."
"@Pol4Trump @madiee_nicole I don't ask for it, honey."
"@madiee_nicole @LimitGovern Shame on me. Who even are you, and why are you talking to me?"
@madiee_nicole https://t.co/FZTyXxCU6m
@BooCunningham How?
@BooCunningham Yes! Will do.
"@LimitGovern Yes, everyone is."
"@madiee_nicole Love you, too."
@LimitGovern @ Sydney. https://t.co/q9j7HroEha
@LimitGovern It's not my fault she's like in love with me or something.
"@LegallyLatina Anyhow, we're FaceTiming tomorrow, so she can finally shut her ugly mouth. I'm telling her to lose weight while we're at it."
There's a girl named Sydney calling me a catfish. Such a compliment. Thank you!
@_Canidae To sum up: https://t.co/hZoZRej0wX
@Pol4Trump Lol!

@exhxdx @MuteMeBby @poolboy88 https://t.co/G44SqoTpMl
@Pol4Trump @MuteMeBby I can't read her tweets. Please stop tagging her. Her handle makes me want to vomit.
@Pol4Trump @MuteMeBby Abundance.
@Pol4Trump @MuteMeBby Champagne is acceptable. https://t.co/qmzEhAOS9u
Rule No. 1: https://t.co/y4QSySvnDu
Are you not entertained?
Never following trashy people back. They will eventually get blocked. Feeling pity is wrong.
"@MuteMeBby Yes, Jesus was trashy. Blocked. https://t.co/vVFcDRUa9D"
@MuteMeBby @poolboy88 Just proof contradicting his arguments.
@MuteMeBby Not a drinker. Trashy.
Excuse the foul language.
"I can be the nicest girl; but if you pull my strings, I can be the biggest bitch."
@MuteMeBby @poolboy88 Rejected. Ouch. https://t.co/ct5OiDZMpE
"@MuteMeBby Sorry, grandma."
@jasonbahri https://t.co/pPoxVQiQ8E
"@MuteMeBby @poolboy88 Actually, it was the other way around. Want proof, honey?"
@MuteMeBby https://t.co/fvCyKADnf8
@MuteMeBby Nope.
"@MuteMeBby @poolboy88 Fine, a hotel."
"@MuteMeBby Age, not life. Assumption."
"@MuteMeBby @poolboy88 Correct, because I cancelled."
"@MuteMeBby Dear 30-year-old, please stop arguing with an 18-year-old. Thank you."
@MuteMeBby Good.
@MuteMeBby https://t.co/7iNxoMvkUT
@MuteMeBby And why are you still talking to me?
@MuteMeBby What are you? Autistic?
"@MuteMeBby Claro que no, enferma."
"@MuteMeBby Wait, are you implying that you don't understand what passive aggressive means?"
@MuteMeBby ¿Por qué?
@MuteMeBby I'd rather be a passive aggressive whore than unblock him.
@MuteMeBby https://t.co/pLSdI5MsW7
@MilosOutfit @Nero This is perfect!
