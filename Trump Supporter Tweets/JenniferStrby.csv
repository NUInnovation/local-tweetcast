@ThbbftTweets @greta Love it!
Cruz-Jr. Sen. from TX - what has he done to protect the boarder for voters that elected him? Nothing! Didn't do it for TX won't do it for US
@DanScavino @realDonaldTrump Thank you - feeling better already!

"@MichaelCohen212 must get back to basics - wall, jobs, self-funding, tough negotiations. Ignore media-remind voters of why we need Trump!"
"@JaredWyand please spread the word - back to basics- build the wall, jobs, tough negotiations, self-funding. All the things we love Trump!"
We can avoid the contested convention by getting Trump to the magic number! Get out there and sell Trump!
@DiamondandSilk Please help us get DJT to the magic #! The rest of this BS will not matter - time to focus on issues and you 2 are the best!
@JaredWyand @LindaSuhler that way the establishment wins and we all lose
@JaredWyand @LindaSuhler what if establishment held Cruz story - hoping DT didn't hit magic #- and then drop sex scandal. Then they pick
"@JedediahBila maybe, just maybe, you are looking in the wrong places to find real men"
@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump funniest tweet of the day!
@BretBaier @brithume @WildBill4701 @stevebruskCNN The problem is YOU are deciding what is news and then telling us what it really means
"@loudobbsnews Please ask Charlie why get rid of the leader @40% to get someone with, say 20-25%? Scary he deals with #'s for a living"
@DiamondandSilk @PeteDominick Thank you ladies for the refresher course! This is what needs to be taught every single day!
@Campaign_Trump stopped following each and every one of them! They are all pathetic
@stephenfhayes @allahpundit @politico you are pathetic
@stephenfhayes if you had bothered to research a little about Trump you'd know this is his stance. Hard to disagree with the common sense
"@stephenfhayes which translates to more people paying into SS - now just keep the politicians from ""borrowing"" from the fund and we are good"
@stephenfhayes now you negotiate better trade deals which allows America to compete which puts more Americans in the workforce...
@stephenfhayes actually stop fraud and hold people accountable. And run the budget they way most run their households will stop waste.
"@stephenfhayes going to explain to you about SS and waste, fraud and abuse. Contracts out for legit bids cuts cost..."
"@stephenfhayes there is nothing Trump can say that you would agree, no matter what. So sad of how closed your mind is."
"@greggutfeld bank robbery is against the law, elected officials passed laws allowing what many businesses do. Use your brain for once."
@stephenfhayes did you make the same comment when Rubio repeatedly made the same reference? Didn't bother you then
@JonahNRO @stephenfhayes hope you realize the GOP needs the Trump supporters to win
@brithume @BuzzFeedBen it says nothing. You're reading into what you want it to say.
"@NumbersMuncher @stephenfhayes @GarrettVentry not sure where you guys get your ""facts"" - YouTube video tells a much different story"
@ChrisStirewalt @brithume Why the fixation to stop Trump? What you are pushing has not worked - let's try something else.
"@TheFix @brithume go ahead, try comparing Rubio to Bill - see how well that works out for you."
@stephenfhayes none of you have been right yet - time to accept none of you are in touch with the new republican voters!
@brithume @ScopeMobber You have become what you say you don't like about Trump-childish insults.
@GeneMcVay Mr. Trump is the only one concerned with Americans! The rest worry about appeasing the world. Let's take care of US!

@stephenfhayes why are you waiting to endorse Hill or Bern? Your time is running out!

"@AndreaTantaros Trump seems to be ""managing"" the issue-not making it about politics or political. Elites can't &amp; won't understand"
@stephenfhayes @continetti last line in article is why Trump is surging-a few GOP elitist cannot claim entire party as your own
@DanScavino real bad news for H about Benghazi coming out. Think press knows and is going after DJT to keep out of headlines?
@stephenfhayes if agreeing w/Trump makes one a bigot it just shows your personal ignorance and intolerance to others who don't agree w/you
@EricTrump Great event!
