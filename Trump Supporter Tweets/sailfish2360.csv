@FoxNews Obama is like the Iraqi on tv during Desert Storm lying to his people they are safe Americans aren't here
"@FoxNews @KirstenPowers @SpeakerRyan Why he can go the same way Cantor (?) did, watching all this on tv"
@FoxNews @oreillyfactor Bingo!
@marklevinshow Enough! This is what happens when all your eggs are in one basket. Bye
@FoxNews @KarlRove Everyone who doesn't want Trump still needs to vote REPUBLICAN. USA can not handle 4-8 more years of these people
@FoxNews @THEHermanCain @realDonaldTrump So far the ones on tv saying they won't vote for Trump are all the losers from the past GOP
@FoxNews @JebBush @realDonaldTrump @TeamCavuto I guess the establishment would rather see Hillary screw this country up more.
@IngrahamAngle I would have liked this but there are 666 likes already. Perfect for the crap the establishment is pulling
"@AnnCoulter, Kelly looks pissed! She doesn't want to be there and will hate the next few months and years with pres. Trump"
@browns_fanly Stop posting about this bum. Doesn't care about anyone but himself
@AnnCoulter I'm glad he mentioned Cruz! That's a winner
Looks like Kelley is discussed that Trump is the nominee. Fox should pull her off the air. I'm heading to CNN
@AnnCoulter Ok just say by and move on
@BenjySarlin @BretBaier @KatyTurNBC Newt!
@FoxNews @JohnKasich Joke! This is what's wrong with the establishment!
@FAIRImmigration Legal immigration is great and needed. ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION cost Americans billions of dollars a year
@FoxNews @DLoesch Yes starting getting in touch with the American people!!!
@FoxNews @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Time to get out and unite the party. Quit screwing around
@JordanPayton @Browns Yes it is so make Cleveland proud and America Great Again. Born in Lakewood always a Browns@fan 53 yrs
@FoxNews Pull a Reagan and fire them all and get teachers that care about the students
@realDonaldTrump @KarlRove Especially after 2012 joke of information about Romney
@FoxNews Equal rights for all!
@DanaPerino Its called selective hearing. Plus being around jet engines for 35 yrs has something to do with it
@foxandfriends Get over it! Dads babysit mother parent.
@foxandfriends Guys die sooner than women so we should get more time to relax and extend the inevitable
@MonicaCrowley @seanhannity @FoxNews Well you're pushing it now.
"@megynkelly @tedcruz @johnboehner Sounds like Business insider said Cruz worked for Boehner. Is Trump right, Lyin Tef?"
https://t.co/7lF7OWsg1q via @youtube Not sure if I should start feeling like the Browns dog yet
https://t.co/7lF7OWsg1q via @youtube here we go
@JACataldo13 @MonicaCrowley @nyjets @FNC_Ladies_Rule Well Browns trade down. Not sure what's worse watching Hillary or Browns draft picks
@PumpkinNation Well I guess I'm ready to change the channel. Not sure what's worse watching Hillary or Browns moving down in draft
Laramy isn't a problem child so the Browns@will probably pick him
@lalalod Born and raised in Cleveland worked at old stadium and watched the team die especially after Johnny Football lost faith w/leaders
@DanaPerino Dallas is hard enough to watch but have to cheer on Buckeyes
@MonicaCrowley @nyjets @FNC_Ladies_Rule Go Browns #8. We will choke again!
@MonicaCrowley @BzzwhpDavid Salt belongs on peanuts popcorn and French fries! Just don't overdue it.
@FoxNews @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump No but your skeleton in the close was on Maury
#Greta hurt
@FoxNews @tedcruz sorry can't watch Fox while Cruz is on
@WITN Hey! Can you say TAPS when talking about a female running mate?
@USAforTrump2016 @tedcruz @CarlyFiorina STOP THE BULLSHIT Trump. You're helping Cruz more that Carly will
@FoxNews @HillaryClinton You should be in jail...
@FoxNews @HillaryClinton if they are illegal they should be sent packing. We are not rounding up legal citizens
@AnnCoulter @CNN I heard I like CNNs map that shows all the   All the districts. I'm a Fox fan not on election nights
@FoxNews @BretBaier @JohnKasich what kind of crap are you telling us? Second is first loser. He only 1 state who cares if he's 2nd
@FoxNews Neither do other Trump follower!
@TheFiveOnFox @FoxNews When is the FBI going to announce charges against Hillary?
@FoxNewsInsider @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Bye!
@AllenWest Hillary does it weekly what's the big deal
@FoxNews @CalThomas Maybe they will all vote Trump since it's hard for@felons to get jobs
@foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump More motivation to get out and vote for Trump
"""Report: Curry Cried After Being Told He Couldn't Return"" via @TeamStream I'm a Cavs fan but get well best wishes https://t.co/gWE1wbIS7j"
"""Brady Will Make His Return in Cleveland"" via @TeamStream Great! He's really going to be pissed thanks judge https://t.co/liinAZOcOZ"
@REALStaceyDash @AccessPolitix Its really sad most of the LBGT community will actual vote her. Can't anyone see through the BS
@browns_fanly To bad he can't be locked up for fraud against Browns fans
@thehill @BretBaier I hope you win for America but if you don't enjoy your life
@FoxNews For someone's supposed to be smart she sure is out to lunch
@washingtonweek @BretBaier @tedcruz @JohnKasich I think someone needs to dig into his twin on Maury
@FoxNews Couple losers hanging on a thread. This will only boost Trump numbers
@TheFiveOnFox NASCAR is turning liberal. Bye
@FoxNews @FoxNewsSunday @DWStweets Why am I going to waste time time watching Fox to see regergerated vomit. Lost viewer
@FoxNews What a dumb ass! I guess our illegal immigrants are not a national security issue. What a clown.
@foxandfriends it better be or@Hillary wins. No ones going to vote.
@FoxNews not goon to Target again. No one sticks up for the majority
@foxandfriends what a joke when is Kate going to be on the quarter? America going to shit!
@FoxNews Who cares!
@FoxNews @EricGuster @realDonaldTrump You are full of crap! People like yourself ranting on the news is what causes the divide
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends I guess Colorado residents are to stoned to care. Wake up people the est. is ruining our lives
