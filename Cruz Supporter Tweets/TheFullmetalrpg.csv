"@alicetweet @lhmist @tedcruz Dude, this is so meta. #CruzWins #WisconsinPrimary"
"@tedcruz plus, Cruz is in a 2.5 man race! Vs Bernie, who is in a 2 man race. Come on man, come on. #WisconsinPrimary"
@tedcruz is almost tied in % points with Bernie Sanders. Why do people doubt Cruz will win? #WIPrimary #CruzWins
"I can't say enough about what Wisconsin has done today. What a romp. #WIPrimary #ForLiberty Just, what a resounding victory. Thanks, yo."
"Is it weird or sad, when the most objective show on @FoxNews is Red Eye? #Fair&amp;Balanced"
@realDonaldTrump @Don_Vito_08 @MELANIATRUMP You are incorrigible in the worst way. I can't even. Literally! #Bully #NeverScum
@tedcruz P.S. Texas is the best! #Texas
Utah just showed @tedcruz more love than his home state of Texas. God bless Utah! #UniteWithCruz
"@PatrickRuffini @benshapiro Please, that would be so awesome. #UniteWithCruz #TrounceTrump"
@tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Admirable sir. You still don't sink to his level. I pray the country sees what I see and votes Cruz. #TrusTed
@TheFullmetalrpg The American people have been chomping at the bit for this! Demand a debate people! #DonaldMustDebate #CowardTrump
"Donald Trump is a COWARD. He is scared to debate Cruz. What else should we think? I REALLY wanna see this, yo! I have been waiting for this!"
@peddoc63 the difference is night and day there. #NeverTrump #UniteWithCruz
"@RichardJSunkle @lhmist @seanhannity Same. Just because he is running as Republican, doesn't mean he auto-gets my vote. #UniteWithCruz"
@SteveDeaceShow @chicagotribune Carson is a huge thorn in #CruzCrew 's side.
@EWErickson LOL. But it's not like we don't expect this sort of thing from him. #NeverTrump #UniteWithCruz
In the end @marcorubio reads from the Bible. In the end it's all about God. Phenomenal speech. Now join Cruz! #UniteWithCruz
@tedcruz doesn't need to apologize for speaking the truth. #UniteWithCruz #DitchMitch
@ChrisLoesch CGI in live action or like Toy Story? #NeverTrump #UniteWithCruz
@SteveDeaceShow @tedcruz Never underestimate a Constitutional Conservative. #UniteWithCruz
@RealJamesWoods @SenTedCruz It says a lot about integrity when a Hollywood actor can say something like this. #DestroyingStereotypes
@CR @RealBenCarson @SteveDeaceShow #NeverTrump #UniteWithCruz
"@CR @RealBenCarson @SteveDeaceShow I would say the betrayal of integrity and decency is disappointing. However, this madness is just sad."
@bennyjohnson This is hilarious! #NeverTrump #UniteWithCruz
"@theblaze @mcuban @tedcruz ""Evolving"" just another word for progressive. Just another word for liberal. #UniteWithCruz"
@tedcruz @CR You break records and they ignore you. But Conservatives know. We know the truth! #UniteWithCruz #TrounceTrump
@BrentBozell Maybe they don't love the country. Imo it looks that way. They say #NeverTrump but don't unite behind Cruz who can win.
@redsteeze @MrJoshPerry @johninkingwood Love Texas. No love for King of the Hill. Hank can go huff propane.
@DAVI93569153 @ToddHagopian @tedcruz Already voted in TX. With you all the way! #ChooseCruz or lose.
@betsy_klein @JoshPainter2154 Brilliant. #UniteWithCruz #TrounceTrump #VoteLiberty
"@danakparish @lhmist @tedcruz @brucereddenjr lol. Feel the same way, but also strange for cheering at a loss. #InterestingTimes #OnlyCruz"
@ToddHagopian #NeverTrump should always = #OnlyCruz. That is if we abide by the first law of thermodynamics.
@freedomtex It's sad how people ignore history.
"Can I just say, God Bless the great state of Wyoming? You got some wise dudes &amp; dudettes there. #UniteWithCruz"
@Tiouririne @elvirewe @KidFancE @mattprivett @bradleytraynor @Mike_Desai @ToddHagopian @Nicki_F @JusticeJimmy Glad someone was keeping track
"@larrymadill This is too great. Unfortunately, however funny it is, it's true and not good for Conservatism. #MissaSad"
UNWAVING?! Kasich has been the only #wackywavinginflatablearmflailing tubeman up there. #GOPDebate
Woah! Did I just hear Trump say Constitution? #GOPDebate
"I am convinced Trump is all about the deal. If they didn't exist, neither would he. #GOPDebate #UniteWithCruz"
How many times in his life has Trump said the word 'deal?' #GOPDebate
@SteveDeaceShow Fire bad! Brings images of Frankenstein to mind. #GOPDebate #UniteWithCruz
"OK, Cruz's ""Neutral Donald"" attack was pretty great and direct. Attacks on Trump should be more direct. #GOPDebate #UniteWithCruz"
"@MattWalshBlog Sorry, I forgot I was living in the Twilight Zone and logic and reason didn't exist. You have a point though."
Ted Cruz has never looked better. He is oozing substance &amp; makes Trump's words hollow. #GOPDebate
@tedcruz @LevinTV @marklevinshow @CR The one day I don't look at twitter and this happens! Finally! #UniteWithCruz #TheGreatOne
@imcrews @emanpatsfan @jphotographer Absolute integrity sir. Thank you. #UniteWithCruz
@FoxNews @ChrisLoesch @DLoesch She is right.
"@ChrisLoesch This is a big deal and blows Trump's ""business guy"" thing out of the water. #UniteWithCruz"
"@SteveDeaceShow @FoxBusiness @realDonaldTrump Wow, and I thought I was desensitized to this lol. #UniteWithCruz"
@amandacarpenter Agreed! #ChooseCruz #OnlyCruz
