@KenFro @galanb @Judy_Taya Exactly what keeps me from saying I'll vote for Trump.If America's going down let it at least be under a Democrat
@maxlydic @Joanie513 @hamnitup You Trumpkins start it then act all offended when u get smacked back. Go to ur safe spaces&amp;leave adults alone
@CapitaLiszt @TshirtInked I think we are definately finding that to be true in this primary.
@galanb @Judy_Taya We're all screwed!  Goodbye America....
@mabry4849 @jean_laclair @JudgeJanna @IvoryDove Gonna go take my energy out on my garden tiller. Thanks for hanging with me! Talk to u later
"@hamnitup You Trumpbots really cannot respect others can ya? Pretty face, ugly heart, stupid mind, dirty mouth &amp; obnoxious personality! Bye"
@jean_laclair @mabry4849 @JudgeJanna @IvoryDove Don't wash just throw! ;)
@IIIPoe Sad isn't it?
@galanb @Judy_Taya The tariffs &amp; taxes will indeed be the nail in thr coffin!
@hamnitup Not today.
@mabry4849 @jean_laclair @JudgeJanna @IvoryDove LOL!
@mabry4849 @jean_laclair @JudgeJanna @IvoryDove For sure!!
@aprilsidea If I see Cruzer attacking I intervene.I don't see it often though.I don't want to be associated w that - today I just had enough
@aprilsidea Tell u what lets talk tomorrow&amp; u ignore me today.I just gots lots pent up frustration not aimed at any one person to get out.K?
@galanb @Judy_Taya Absolutely!!
@IIIPoe I tell ya! What Trumpbots don't get is that they are sealing their own fates as the underclass w a few elites in charge
@mabry4849 @jean_laclair @JudgeJanna @IvoryDove May be past time for love and logic &amp; time now to throw dishes &amp; break things!! ;-)
@mabry4849 @jean_laclair @JudgeJanna @IvoryDove I honestly don't see much difference between Obamabot liberals &amp; Trumpbot Republicans
@jean_laclair @mabry4849 I know but it made me chuckle!! :)
@mabry4849 @JudgeJanna @IvoryDove After it burns they are gonna whine even more rhat it's our fault. Lost cause!
@mabry4849 @jean_laclair @JudgeJanna @IvoryDove Unfortunately they are gonna take r country down with them when they do.
@mabry4849 @jean_laclair @JudgeJanna @IvoryDove It's like ur kid arguing irrationally for months after while u just have to watch them fail
@jean_laclair @mabry4849 LMBO!!
@jean_laclair @mabry4849 @JudgeJanna @IvoryDove I've had a few but when they get out facted they always end up hatefully vile.
@mabry4849 @JudgeJanna @IvoryDove I get anger. I get angry. But burning the whole house down with 1/2 ur party in it is a suicide mission!
@mabry4849 He's done a great job! Couldn't ask for more. He shouldn't have to fight mudslinging from a loud mouthed reality tv demagogue
@mabry4849 Yes or independents or just Honey Boo Boo viewers who needed something to do when the show ended.....
@mabry4849 @JudgeJanna @IvoryDove They were not involved in the party before their celebrity demagogue appeared &amp; r driving over the cliff
@mabry4849 I definitely hit crazy today! The irrationality if 1/2 our party is just dumbfounding added to their vileness.....
Gonna need it to stop Trump if elected too. https://t.co/632uFDMHZN
@mabry4849 @JudgeJanna @IvoryDove This is r country they r playing with!
I know. Today I hit a breaking point. After a while the stupid attacks &amp; unwillingness to be rational gets to people https://t.co/zzfQ2dYGta
@Fingersflying Trump is not a social conservative.
@aprilsidea I am a really nice person who has been driven over the edge by my own party!!!
"@aprilsidea If ya'll want civil, pleasant &amp; logical then stand  up to ferocious Trump Train folks- they r creating hostility in Rep party"
"@aprilsidea Ya'll want us to be pleasant, polite &amp; logical but don't hold ur own to same standards watching silently as ""ur side"" attacks"
@aprilsidea We say there's no moderate Muslims because even those not killing don't speak out well the same thing is true of this Trump cult
"@aprilsidea Where was ur outrage as myself and others in the party have been attacked, called names and abused by the Trumpkins for months?"
@aprilsidea If this is bed that Trump voters want to make then so be it but don't complain when u get a party modeled after ur candidate
"@aprilsidea They attack perpetually. Logic, facts &amp; history r irrelevant. It's so far past civil discourse &amp; it's fueled by Trump himself"
@aprilsidea This candidate&amp;group u choose associate ur self w.They r rude hateful &amp; attack as a group.This is the world Trumpism's creating
@aprilsidea LMAO! Rude? Really? Trump supporters have not just the corner but the entire galaxy when it comes to RUDE! Ya'll  created this!
@TexHellCat @jtkahle @MarkMcknz Oohhh! Bbbbbuuuuuurrrrrrnnnnnn!!!!
@bakerlarry84 @Jedel123 @FoxNews Nope!
@TexHellCat @jtkahle @MarkMcknz I blocked him. He's just an agitator.
@jtkahle @TexHellCat @MarkMcknz Trumpies good at disgusting &amp; telling others to behave. Go have ur fun in private with ur mirror.
@TexHellCat @jtkahle @MarkMcknz LOL!
@TexHellCat @MarkMcknz Me too. Educate them &amp;make them strong they will need to make their way to upper echelons to escape Trump voter class
An example of illogical idiocy in the flesh.... https://t.co/QMuTfiqaIS
@TexHellCat @jtkahle @MarkMcknz JT is just antagonist idiot Shelly. He's poking u for his own sick pleasure probably mastu.... at same time
@jtkahle @TexHellCat @MarkMcknz U should go destroy America &amp; leave me alone.
@TexHellCat @MarkMcknz I'm numb to the fear now. So be it but not in my name! Me &amp; mine r educated &amp; secure.
"@jtkahle @TexHellCat @MarkMcknz Yep, the rest will get destroyed why not elections, peaceful assembly, personal choices...."

@MarkMcknz I hope ur right.Guess I'm discouraged by the stupidity w/in r party &amp;constant bullying by those who weren't even involved 1yr ago
Given the obnoxious uninformed way Trumpies have worked to destroy r party platform destruction of party no big deal https://t.co/OAZNEfG77D

@Thomas_IL_ LMBO! Thank you for the laugh! That was refreshing! :)
@MarkMcknz I did too until IN. I've never even hoped Obama died. Can't help it though. I see such a disaster for so many people coming
@thegreatpumba1 I think ya'll misjudged how demoralizing Trump steam roller has been to a big part of party who like me see no upside to him

"DT folks ignore facts, flip flops, criminal investigations, disgusting behavior &amp; bully but r amatures who won't outdo democrats in Nov"

@AbolishBBC Not in mood to mince words. He's OLD!
@ruffedge America cannot survive too much more of a hero seeking stupid populas. History is clear on this issue.
