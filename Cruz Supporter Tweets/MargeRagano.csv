@nunuvyerbiz @ChuckNellis Amen
@RevelationOpen @TCuccio Amen
@ChuckNellis  and we need a President that humbles (Cruz) himself before God and not think he is one (Trump).

@FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Walter Mondale size defeat
@FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews my favorite memory is when you were fair and balanced. How are your ratings since you turned your back on ur motto?
@CarolVicic @FoxNews and their ratings reflect it.
@tedcruz @CarlyFiorina #CruzCarly2016 #cruzcrew

@Judy_Taya @theblaze @IndianaUniv says the man with a volatile temper. Wait am I talking about Trump or Bobby Knight?
@loumaz6 or the smartest
@loumaz6 is anyone really shocked Bobby Knight endorsed Trump? They have the same temperament!
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump by creating tariffs? That only hurts the middle class who you claim you are trying to protect. Smh
@ChrisLoesch @SeeTac7 they are clapping seals....... Ignoring every word
@DeanClancy @LiveFreedomOrDi and that is what we call a ringing endorsement
@NeverTrumpGear @LiveFreedomOrDi @seanhannity just a sorry state of affairs for Sean. Sad just sad
@CarlyFiorina what a great VP pick. I gave to 2 campaigns Ted's and yours. Now I can give to both on one ticket I will pray for both of you

@VA4Cruz2016 another Star Wars quote I fear comes to. And this is how liberty dies with thunderous applause.
@VA4Cruz2016 anger is a powerful emotion. I have never made a good decision when I'm angry. My fear is we live with decisions made for us.
https://t.co/JFg5GcuWa9 @ChuckNellis Trumps NE wins were already factored in. Read and keep the faith that help is on the way @tedcruz
@MattWalshBlog I'm ashamed to be from Pennsylvania
