@crnylife @BoSnerdley why give them web traffic?
"@tonykatz @jimgeraghty Kasich is helping Trump by staying in; keeps dividing the few scraps of not-Trump media coverage. WI, MI, Kasich map?"

"@nohilary MT, not MN"
@nohilary Drumpf got over 50% in NY only. You are more delusional than most Trumpkins if you think he will get NY results all over
"@nohilary Oh, it's a lot more than 55. Drumpf will get swept in MN, NE, SD, etc."
@nohilary @DonAlt_Right Changing values? Trump had three opposing views on abortion in three hours

@FoxBusiness Why is this Trumpist lying picture and story running in FoxBusiness?
@scottienhughes Cruz is very competent but he couldn't know about Kasich's incompetence ahead of time. Automated Trumpkin bots are mad
@larryelder non-sense. McConnell blocked any real repeal. Cruz fought it while Trump funded anti-repeal Obamacare crowd. #NeverTrump
