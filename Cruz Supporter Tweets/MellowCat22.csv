@WayneRoot @realDonaldTrump There is nothing you could say to get me to support the filthy pig.  I'm not so easily Grubered. #NeverTrump
@greta @GOP @Reince @FoxNews Then my donations 2 the RNC should be refunded straight out of the thieving orange bastard's bank account.
"@greta @GOP @Reince @FoxNews While the RNC provided the ungrateful, orange little prick an entire campaign infrastructure for free."
"@terrimore1 @conradhackett Trump supporters think pointing out his record &amp;  actual words is ""beating up on him"" so don't give me that crap."
@FoxNews @rickklein #Drumpf disenfranchises voters as bad as #Faux News disenfranchises viewers. #NeverTrump #Cruz2016
@conradhackett Proof the media picks our leaders.  #Cruz has been beaten up by virtually all media outlets. They're corrupt. #NeverTrump
"@FoxNews @MaraLiasson Until the orange liberal fascist gets 1237, it ain't over. #Drumpf will just have to keep fueling his jet. Too bad."
@LOVEINE @LouDobbs @kimguilfoyle  @FoxBusiness @FoxNews We tuned out the tabloid trash fraud network long ago.  CNN is beating these clowns.
@politico Would this have been before  making fun of her face or after? I wouldn't let the disgusting pig get his orange filth all over me.
"@THEHermanCain @ChuckNellis Exposed yourself as a fraud, Cain.  Must suck to be you. #NeverTrump #Cruz2016"

"@PK2929 @theblaze They are just trying to get more Trump ratings. They are still a dishonest network, tho better than tabloid trash #Faux."
@LiveFreedomOrDi @MSNBC @tedcruz Typical white trash Obama phone #Drumpf supporter.  #NeverTrump #Cruz2016
@alison_rambles He's doing nothing but getting #Drumpf to the nomination.  His  ties w/#Faux News &amp; Newt Gingrich convince me even more.
@MSNBC @tedcruz Go Senator Cruz!  Make that orange child rapist earn the 1237 he feels entitled to.  #NeverTrump #Cruz2016

"@RestlessNews @politico He apparently likes him enough to vote for him.  Apparently #Drumpf tried, but couldn't ""make the deal."" #NeverTrump"
@politico Well he IS a fraud.  Just like the media.  #NeverTrump #Cruz2016
@StopTrumpPAC There have been so many polls tweeted out today that have wildly opposite results.  I don't believe any of them at this point.

@DyanLondon444 Yep.  And I became #RarelyFox back when Draft-Dodging Donald was constantly bloviating on that network like a paid staffer.
@DaBearsk @StopTrumpPAC @arrjet17  I'm sure #Faux News will manufacture one shortly. #NeverTrump #Cruz2016
