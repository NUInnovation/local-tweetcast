@tfitorlifeShaw @chadpradelli @CamEdwards We are an aggressive species. It's going to happen.
@campusreform these folks really need something constructive to do. Like work. #GetALife
@theblaze @benshapiro Well bless their hearts.... what a bunch of crybabies!  #GetOverYourself
@lybr3 @gehrig38 @espn I'm done with ESPN.
@campusreform @USC @AGockowski These people are going to keep on until they start closing schools.
@chadpradelli @CamEdwards It's a damn shame that 2 people aren't able to fight it without one getting jumped by friends. #cowards
@SenFrankNiceley I love to see government spending so much tax money on stuff like this.  #sarcasm
@SenFrankNiceley @justified6271 @Gatortrapper @NathalieQueen3 Haven't the rules always been the same? I remember reading it was acompromise
@MissSelfDefense @Kmsp Guess who won't be taking his 2 young daughters to @Target anymore? It's a shame really.
@runningforpizza Reparations for what!? Not a single American alive today has been a slave. Just looking for a handout.
@campusreform People calling others made up words in order to shame them into submission.
@SenFrankNiceley @thehill So alcohol is an attractant for sexual predators?  He's a joke.
@campusreform @AGockowski Free speech getting nibbled away at in bits and pieces.  All fun and games til they silence you. #1A
"@TeaPartyOrg Is it not enough anymore to just be unique. Gotta be ""trans"" something and push it on others?"
@TeaPartyOrg Then he should run.
"@runningforpizza @MMFlint A ""bigoted"" law that keeps men out of restrooms and showers with little girls that have no choice. Thank you NC"
@FoxNews Are people no longer allowed to have an opinion?  Not agreeing with gays does not automatically equal hate.
@twilson00 @FoxNews Insults? You go on believing that you're the greatest being there is and leave me be.
"@twilson00 @FoxNews I'll take ""magic and fairytales"" over self-centered obsession any day."
@FoxNews So a cop is getting punished for spreading some love and hope?  Anyone else see a problem with this!?
@FoxNews @MattFinnFNC Fact is that none of these sorry people have to stay in AMERICA. Could always go somewhere better. #Merica
@cristinalaila1 @SenSanders it's all about getting more of the money that we work so hard for. Easily said by a lazy bum.
@FoxNews @annakooiman You can see how uncomfortable Obama gets.
@MissSelfDefense Exactly why I shop at Kroger's. #2A
@kangertech When will the 316L coils be available?
@FoxNews @HillaryClinton Apparently there are a lot of people in this country that have zero clue.
"These celebs are full of themselves. A Pastor should not be forced to perform same@sex marriages.

@MissSelfDefense @walidshoebat But Obama isn't a Muslim? #Bull
@FoxNews @oreillyfactor @foxnewspoll @SenSanders @realDonaldTrump You sure are pushing Kasich all of a sudden. #sellouts
@kangertech Which TC setting on the Nebox so I use for the 316L coils?
Moderate my rear end. #2A https://t.co/eqCTuQUSb2
"@AlfGarnettTil @runningforpizza why are people so...... Just plain unable to think, realistically, for themselves."
"He's ""abrasive"" because he's straight up. I have the same problem with people. @tedcruz  #1A https://t.co/ERmWNwKCfm"
@kangertech How!?  Do I set for Ni or Ti?
@AlienGHolsters Which shell do I need to fit a Vickers Tactical Glock 19?
@kangertech I hope they are better than the Vaperosa ones.
@kangertech Can we oppression?
@RealAlexJones Apparently the prize doesn't mean what it once did.
"@TeaPartyOrg So essentially he's trying to ""strong arm"" voters."
@FoxNews @DouglasESchoen Senate has the authority to confirm or DENY. It's not required to confirm potus's appointment.
@campusreform @AGockowski Yet she's OK with world that babies spoiled kids and denies other's rights?  #joke
@varepall wow
@FiveRights All men. Tell me again how it's not takeover.
@kangertech Do the SSOCC SS316L coils work in temp control mode for the NEBOX?  #confused
#AskPressSec Where does Judge Garland stand on the 2A?
"Policies should be based on facts, not fear. @POTUS, weakening Apple's defenses puts us all at risk. https://t.co/FzhOhNrVgH"
@TeaPartyOrg So what they're saying is that violence isn't OK..... Until it is!?  #hypocrit
"@FoxNews That's a go to defense for most wrongdoers. We ALL have some type of ""psychiatric issue""."
@campusreform Traumatized!?   Seriously!?  These people know nothing about being traumatized. Grow a set.
@DineshDSouza That man is so full of crap.
"@FoxNews @johnrobertsFox There's a right and a wrong way of ""getting your voice heard"""
@campusreform They must not be paying taxes.
@campusreform The ones that caved obviously have no character. Stand for what you believe in.
"@campusreform Now that's ""inclusion""."
"@TeaPartyOrg ""The opinion of two white men is not valid,” and I thought they were trying to defeat racism."
"@TeaPartyOrg After heated debate, in which one student was heard screaming that “The opinion of two white men is not valid,”"
"@campusreform So basically they were ""forced"" to vote for it.   Talk about some character."
"@SenFrankNiceley @thehill It's like ""let's see how dumb my voters really are""."
