@God_Son80 I choose you all day every day lol
@GOP #BlazeDebate
As much as I love the mets it's going to be hard rooting against the Cubs I mean I'm a mets fan but cmon who doesn't wanna see the Cubs win1
@ColemanESPN as a mets fan I believe the suspension is unnecessary
As a fan of the #Mets there's no reason for  #ChaseUtley to be suspended it's postseason baseball this stuff happens
@ColemanESPN I honestly think Philbin lost his job last year wk17 but were waiting for this blowup to pull the trigger
@BigOShow ik you think tannehil isn't the answer but I think he is if we get a line but we need to drop Philbin tomorrow
@JamesWalkerNFL you think the dolphins will have a new head coach by tomorrow?
I vote @God_Son80 landry as new head coach of the #miamidolphins RT if you agree
Can I apply for the #miamidolphins head coach position
TD #miamidolphins let's go #PhinsUp
Weird I thought maybe the #miamidolphins would of got that screen pass 4 the 1st too bad it hasn't worked all year on 3rd #Insanity
Sure would be nice if the #miamidolphins can do SOMETHING at all
Disgusting loss Sunday but let's show London what dolphins football is #PhinsUp
@Kold91 bad luck today but it ain't over let's go phins #PhinsUp #phinsSB50
@ColemanESPN how fun will Brady have with Suh on the other side of him
@ColemanESPN is it possible for dolphins to win and still get rid of Philbin
