@DougHaller @ASTATE_8 congrats! I was hoping you would go to patriots you fit well there!
@DougHaller wow. Ohio state is loaded with talent. I think in years ahead ASU will have more draftees

I checked in at Snug On The Square on #Yelp https://t.co/fYM2pWqVdo
@DougHaller ok. I'll have to wait and see. :-)
@DougHaller who would you say just from your observations the best QB is ? Or who you think would get the starting role? Too early to tell?
@sandecharles sweet! Thx! Look forward to seeing them!
@sandecharles @DevilsDigest good morning! Will you be posting some more video clips?
@jeffmetcalfe they haven't been the same since coach Murphy left
@PJStrikeForce @DailyCaller that's a stretch at best.
@LeeAnnMcAdoo they anticipating a brokered convention in which they would nominate Rubio? Cruz/trump supporters/patriots would be pissed!
@NH92276 we have a chance. numbers in Louisiana for example showed trump leading big in early voting but day of election Cruz won!
@NH92276 I did I voted for Cruz in Texas. Hopefully the other states will follow suit
@NH92276 @DrSlappyShorts you have to vote trump over Hillary. Of course I'm hoping Cruz wins
@NH92276 @DrSlappyShorts you can't be serious right? I'm with you I don't like trump but you have t remember what's at stake. Sup court
@amrightnow @SweepsFox hahahahaha
@Ellysa_Maye awesome!
@DineshDSouza @Debber66 @tedcruz amen! And congratulations!
@bishopmikey @Mediaite I agree it's over for Ben but it's a good call to get them all together. We need Carson in some type of gov position
I voted today! I was having fun with the ladies that were out talking to voters. #TexasPrimary #ChooseCruz https://t.co/egxBMc5mwJ
@TheRealHarvo what opportunity do you see that's unequal that you are fighting for?
@Ellysa_Maye are you in Texas?
@DaltonRoss @jeffmetcalfe why did they not clap for her?
@ResistTyranny Ted Cruz fought the Washington establishment Trump donated to it!
@ResistTyranny your tag is resist tyranny but your voting for trump? Why not Cruz? Don't you think trump would bring tyranny?
@TIMENOUT that was funny. Trump got killed in the debates last night though. Cruz gets my vote
@DineshDSouza @Saint_Obama keep up the good work! We need you out there!
"@RealBenCarson I supported u early on but we now must stop trump, have u considered stop ur campaign so someone (Cruz) can beat trump?"
@KatrinaPierson you know that Cruz is the only true conservative. Why are you with trump?
@Saint_Obama yes He is. I don't see why evangelicals can't see past trump and are not voting for Ted Cruz... It blows my mind
@Saint_Obama are you optimistic tonight in NV? I'm watching Fox News to see the outcomes and I'm getting discouraged.
@greta @FoxNews NO #greta
@greta No #greta
@seanhannity come on Sean! I thought you were supposed to be fair and balanced? You give an hour to trump? Come on!
"@realmadpatriots I just want to know how you can be a mad ""patriot"" and vote for trump over Cruz? Cruz is the only patriot running!"
@FairOaksTrader Ur headline says restoring true conservatism to America. U should know only Cruz can do that! Wake up man! Are u a patriot?
@FairOaksTrader seems like u are a patriot. You of all people should see that Cruz is the only patriot in the race. Have u seen his record?
@FairOaksTrader When Cruz was filibustering Obamacare Rubio couldnt be found Trump was praising single-payer You angry? Cruz is your fighter
@FairOaksTrader The people that are most educated are voting Cruz. They know his track record It's impeccable. I thought you'd bring that up
@FairOaksTrader prove to me that he's lying and I'll believe you
@FairOaksTrader bs. You've drank the media and trump koolaid
@JohnDetton @Ellysa_Maye Carson votes would go to Cruz !! ðŸ™‚
@IngrahamAngle I'm wondering why she didn't endorse Cruz. Any thoughts?
@EvanDaniels any idea on which school Thon Maker is leaning?
@BristolsBlog @ArcticFox2016 why did your mom endorse trump and not a true conservative patriot like Ted Cruz?
@ClaMakayla hahaha me too!
@ColinCowherd thoughts on the NFL and black panther issue and how they align with propaganda consistently? Ratings? How can we change it?
@DavidAFrench I hope so. Also by kasik and bush staying in it helps Cruz. Cruz is the winner tonight. He'll win the south.
@850Sunny @DecisionDeskHQ thanks for the update. This is big for Cruz! He will surge in the south
@loudobbsnews maybe Cruz will surprise ;)
@Ellysa_Maye do you think Cruz will outperform Tuesday in New Hampshire and surprise everyone?
@loudobbsnews I think Cruz will surprise by getting more votes than the polls predict.
@matthewung so frustrating!
@matthewung yep it's sad. But it seems like nobody cares
"@jeffmetcalfe oh, your saying new OC wants open competition. My bad"
@jeffmetcalfe are you saying new OC would prefer Perkins?
@WayneDupreeShow I think k Cruz will surprise the polls in New Hampshire. Meaning he'll get more than expected.
"@DougHaller ok. I was thinking Brady white was the golden recruit last year, maybe they like more mobile. All 3 (4) are really good it seems"
@jeffmetcalfe @DougHaller any insight on QB competition. Safe 2 assume Perkins will get it based on recruiting his former teammates?
@jeffmetcalfe @DougHaller that's good considering a lot of things
Good pickup for Todd Graham  https://t.co/z6PV4aKoPi
@asu96 @DougHaller been weird at ASU.  Had momentum in graham tenure but huge blows at coaching losses and bad season. Hope they can rebound
@fbcjaxwatchdog hi j was trying to find your YouTube channel I enjoy but did you delete it? Where do you keep all of your videos? Thanks
@jeffmetcalfe @DougHaller @azcentral I would definitely suggest seat backs or some type of comfortable seats
"@mattsorger please agree for the lord to heal my son, Remnant (he goes by Remy). Been sick with a virus, constipation. He's 3 yrs old."
@BDenny29 with a few more recruits we could get into the teens again. OC dilemma could hurt recruiting??
@ColinCowherd man I'm shocked. What's up with NE Colin?
@stephenasmith curious your thoughts on the Burfict hit? It didn't seem like he hit him hard at all....
@stephenasmith yep I agree.
@DougHaller ok thanks. Makes sense.  How do you see ASU football going forward? In good hands?
@DougHaller @azcentral curious if you have any inside story on how this all happened and why? And what's the future for ASU football?
Can't believe the refs did Bobby Hurley like that
"@Manny_Wilkins5 I agree man, looking forward to next year"
@TheFaceOfCali go get it!!! Next year will be awesome. I believe in you!
@rudygcarp12 good point. I was wondering how they said OC came straight in and team didn't need to adjust. Hope he has a better plan next yr
@rudygcarp12 I agree! Do you think they would have done better with Manny or 1 of the others at QB this year? Or is that not a fair question
Horrible season for ASU football. Thank God it's over.
@DougHaller hahahaha good one!
@HawkeyePacker81 I hope so. I like Iowa. My family farms there. They were sad
@StrutnWuf @jppalmCBS @MatthewCassell1 MSU and Iowa both got embarrassed. I felt bad for them. That's why I was making that point.
@Spartydawg14 @MatthewCassell1 @jppalmCBS now you see why I didn't want MSU in. Got embarrassed. So did Iowa. I feel bad for them. Smh
@HawkeyePacker81 @jppalmCBS now you see why this year I liked Stanford? MSU &amp; Iowa were not up to par for their bowls. Embarrassed
@K_Dodd3 thanks.... Yeah hopefully!!!
@K_Dodd3 @SteveMims_RG any news on Savon Godman? ASU needs him in Pac 12 play
@NFL @10NewsKeogh beast mode cardinals looking great!
@10NewsKeogh I can definitely relate!
@SunDevilSource ok that's great! Thanks for clearing it up! Go Devils!cant wait to see it!
@natemorris75 ok thanks. Internet said something about them playing elsewhere for awhile. Wasn't sure about the accuracy
@natemorris75 do you know what the timeline is of them finishing?
@DougHaller I agree ASU needs a little more time winning. Would you say they'd be in the top 30 though?
"Good job Bobby Hurly, finally making ASU BB competitive. Bout time! Huge win last night vs. uNLV with Savon out too! https://t.co/sBiVFKDJkQ"
@JimThemaniac1 I agree Norvell was getting stale. Similar offense but I hope he makes better red zone decisions and airs it out down field!
@MochanTheMan2 congrats! And welcome to the brotherhood! #SunDevilNation #sundevils @FootballASU
@SunDevilEquip @FootballASU @Cactus_Bowl does adidas have special uniforms for bowl games?
@NkealHarry15 can't wait to see you play next season!
@NkealHarry15 that's right bro! Nice letter....
@DougHaller I was hoping to see them play a #1 team. But it makes ASU schedule tougher as UCLA will most likely be ranked when they play
@kobebryant nice letter Kobe! You were always my favorite player!
@DougHaller you do excellent work! Thank you for all of the content you always provide us with for @TheSunDevils
@DougHaller @SBNationCBB hilarious!
@StrutnWuf @jppalmCBS @MatthewCassell1 why is that?
"@jppalmCBS don't take personal, i see you are a spartan alum, i'm being objective.  It's important to stay objective in sports. We'll see..."
"@jppalmCBS just don't want to see them get embarrassed. I'm not against Mich ST. I actually like them, just wouldn't put them or iowa in"
"@jppalmCBS i agree, listen, all i'm saying is the committee should put the 4 best teams in and take that into consideration. i like Mch St."
@WildcatReport @jppalmCBS yes sir!
@jppalmCBS Iowa and Michigan at both should be out of top 4. Michigan state technically lost to Michigan. I'd put Stanford in
@Mr4thAndLong @1053thefan both cool! Edge to Cams
@JaszminB I am!
@SavonGoodman11 yes sir!!! Go get the championship!
@ZackDanielPerry were all qualified if we are in Christ. We're already qualified. Actually we don't have to qualify. Jesus did it for us
@DougHaller @azcentral do u know what the all time head 2 head is when taking out the games played before ASU was a university? Tempe Normal
@DougHaller strategy
@ColinCowherd @perkyjerky hey Colin! My first time trying! You're right best jerky ever! https://t.co/00oifEGrcu
https://t.co/8HEGPVnnKz
@SotDPodcast thanks for the update. That will be great to have him in rotation. Davon Durant out for good?
@SotDPodcast @FootballASU that's great news! Motivation for next year. Will we get Cameron smith back next year too?
"@NkealHarry15 we'd be honored to have you at ASU. And can I say, WE NEED YOU! #ASU"
@AndreaTantaros wow!
@realDonaldTrump @michael_favreau @WSJ I watched debate. this website is misleading.  He said he did speeches for the company and takes it.
@CodyButler10x objectively I think norvell called good game last night. But I'm surprised he passed twice from 4 yd line in 3OT. Feel 4 ASU
@cfantastic0101 @Khaylan7 @ReemKnows1 great play but doesn't matter if coaches can't close the win! I'm so sad about the loss to Oregon
@CoachGrahamASU norvell had 1st and goal from 4 in triple OT!!! Why pass? Run the ball and try to punch it in! Come on!!!!
@ASU_Rivals @PTDVLR 1st and goal from 4 yd line. MUST CLOSE THAT WIN!!! Norvell not thinking!
@CodyButler10x @ESPNCFB stats don't matter. Wins do. Gotta close!
@CodyButler10x @ESPNCFB with the talent we have we should be scoring in red zone and putting games away. Have u noticed the bad calls?
@CodyButler10x @ESPNCFB norvell hasn't been a good play caller for 2 years
@rudygcarp12 horrible. I#1st and goal from 4 yd line!!! Run the ball! What r u thinking norvell!  Gosh! So pissed!
@ESPNCFB ASU has sooo much talent but bad offensive coaching had held them back all year! Get with it #ASU
@Mike__OC @TheSunDevils seriously if norvell could call we could have been in playoff last year and in first this year. Horrible! Runball
@TheSunDevils horrible ending! Why did he not run it? OC norvell needs to go! Horrible.
@DougHaller why did they not run it at the end? What the heck?
@052682 the yoke of law is a heavy burden that religious people misinterpret as responsibility. Jesus encourages us 2 respond to His ability
"@052682 heavy laden in Mat 11 = to place a burden upon, to load metaph. to load one with a burden (of rites and unwarranted precepts)"
@052682 Mat. 11:28-30 mkmsg/ rest of grace is not 2 be understood as passive non activity / but a walk in Gods power &amp; strength 1 cor 15:10
@052682 It speaks of entering His rest - heb 4 / Jesus spoke of being burnt out on religion Mat. 11:28-30
@052682 ha! Rom 2:28 helps prove my point! Out!!!
"@052682 you don't understand what I'm saying. Praying for you. All good. This is a misuse of time.  If you really are seeking, PM me... Out!"
"@052682 trust me, I've been where you are right now. God will reveal if you keep seeking Truth."
@052682 it comes with spiritual maturity. And the question is. Of who gave it. It's who he gave it to and for what
@052682 you seem like you want to argue. I'm not here to do that. Ask God to show you. I never said anything about abolishment.
@052682 read Romans 8
@052682 you need to understand what the new covenant is. Private message me and I will send you my contact info. If you want explanation
@052682 does what
@052682 you can put yourself under law if you want.  I'm not here to convince anyone. Only to proclaim truth. Law will kill you every time
@052682 it was before He died. You and I are in a new covenant after the cross. Too much to explain on Twitter
Powerful lyrics! Enjoy!! Wait For You - Gateway Worship feat. Rebecca Hart (Studio Version) https://t.co/KjtFT2cDSd
@052682 we can be at rest continually even if we are physically working. It's a different kind of rest than physical. Make sense?
@052682 I'm saying we should not make it a law. If we obey 1 we have to obey all. Levitical ceremonial etc. Jesus came 2 set us free from it
"@052682 Jesus healed on the sabbath, in which he explained himself. I'm not saying you shouldn't take a day of physical rest from work."
@052682 I'm talking about having a heart (belief system) and mind that is continually at rest. Jesus is Lord of the sabbath is he not?
@052682 you don't know what your talking about. Your reading in English first of all and secondly that Verse has nothing to do with rest.
@NH92276 @mcspocky @Bipartisanism yes she sure is!
@ColinCowherd wow. Ridiculous
@PsGarySimons I'm not anti-sabbath. I'm saying in Christ we are under a continual sabbath. At rest in the finished work of Jesus!
"@NEWONTHEINSIDE @PsGarySimons Gary, this is an excellent teaching.Touched a lot of the scripture I can't on a tweet http://t.co/A2iGVzb7vw"
"@PsGarySimons I just thought about... Under new covenant we are under a continual rest and sabbath, so we don't need to observe 1 day."
@jeffmetcalfe @ASU_Rivals why did Clint even leave? He was doing so well
@DougHaller manny seems fast in the ground too.
@ColinCowherd bears? Not sure about that one. Their terrible
