@scottyhasty @tcp1775 @JusticeRanger1 I didn't express my opinion. I said what I think Trump thinks. Get it? He's the immoral liberal! Duh.
"@scottyhasty @tcp1775 @JusticeRanger1 Wow you aren't very rational, are you? What you said made no sense at all. Do you realize that?"
@WayneDupreeShow @ranchdancer Seems pretty obvious to me!
@ranchdancer @tcp1775 Yeah it's odd. Ivanka was too young to realize that. Trump should have but he says weird things about his little girls
"@MorganVids I have a policy of blocking haters, and also people telling lies that support Trump. I like dialogue but have my boundaries."
"@tcp1775 @scottyhasty @JusticeRanger1 I agree, I don't think DT is a pedo. Based on his comments, he just thinks it's not that bad."
Could Trump ban military officials from giving interviews? I guess so; BHO got away with violating the Constitution. https://t.co/E89AWb4CMt
Trump's narcissism makes it difficult to see other people as real human beings. That's why he makes these comments. https://t.co/TkdlBqh72r

@MorganVids @deaconlunchbox @BlissTabitha So I was shaming deaconlunchbox for saying he'd like to shoot a kid. Repulsive and wrong.
"@MorganVids @deaconlunchbox @BlissTabitha On twitter, the first handle in a tweet is the only one a tweet is talking to, technically."
"@MorganVids @CiscoJimmy @BlissTabitha I am married to a Mexican, a real Mexican. You are referring to Chicanos, right? 1st &amp; 2nd generation."
@CiscoJimmy @MorganVids @BlissTabitha Chicanos don't fit in when they visit Mexico. Their anti-American behavior embarrasses real Mexicans.
"@CiscoJimmy @MorganVids @BlissTabitha Most of the protestors are actually Chicanos. They grew up in America as a minority, seeking identity."
@deaconlunchbox @BlissTabitha @MorganVids Shame on you!
"@BlissTabitha What's so stupid is, if Cali were Mexican, it would be like Tijuana. Think this kid would rather grow up in Tijuana? No way!"
@MorganVids @CiscoJimmy @BlissTabitha Mexicans who come as adults don't assimilate. They don't consider this their home. Ask one of them.
"@SideshowJon36 @JadedByPolitics @BlissTabitha @instapundit I'll tell you why! Bc Mexico is full of poverty, corrupt police &amp; bad politicians"

@kjb1968 LOL I know ppl are saying this. It's unrealistic. Trump's an expert in real estate &amp; self-promotion. He's not trying to learn more.
@jmc_cipras I agree. You're right about that. What do you see as the most important cause of division?
"@kjb1968 I wish that Donald Trump was reliable on foreign affairs, economics, and the Constitution. He's not, and he doesn't want to be."

@FourthN13 Your stupid propaganda is riddled with deception. I'm not so stupid to believe the Trump lies.

"@kjb1968 @CelebrateTheWin Trump funded pols who stole from We the People and taken our liberties. Cruz argued b4 SCOTUS, defended our rights"
@kjb1968 @CelebrateTheWin Cruz has fought for our liberties his whole career. He even opposed GWB so we can stay free. Trump did what? Nada.
@CelebrateTheWin I gotta block u as both a hater and as one of Trump's lying minions.
"@CelebrateTheWin @jmc_cipras @JudgeMoroz A barefaced, hateful lie! Shame on you! How can you slander me &amp; other fellow patriotic Americans!?"
@CelebrateTheWin @kjb1968 The pathological liar is Trump &amp; most Americans see it. U know how Obama fans can't see his lies? Trump fans same.
@kjb1968 @JudgeMoroz I'm not NeverTrump &amp; I'm not willing to back Hill. She's a Communist &amp; Islamist sympathizer. At least Trump isn't that!
