"@ShopCristi @brady2edelman @pastormarkburns @ZarkoElDiablo @USAlivestrong @tedcruz go back to FB, we don't want you."
@brady2edelman @USAlivestrong @pastormarkburns and another clever trumpster #nevertrump #endofstory
@Sheri_Hischild @USAlivestrong @pastormarkburns and some of you should get off Twitter.
@pcgameplayer1 @fooschamp95 @USAlivestrong @pastormarkburns I wouldn't advertise the fact. We already know trumpsters are libs.
@Sheri_Hischild @USAlivestrong @pastormarkburns anyone ever tell you that you look like bette Midler? Sad!
"What about the 6mil for vets, think he forgot? #NeverTrump  https://t.co/X20Dbd9PsR"
@Sheri_Hischild @USAlivestrong @pastormarkburns then why are you tweeting at me? #NeverTrump  #endofstory

@fooschamp95 @pastormarkburns @tedcruz good luck.
"@fooschamp95 @pastormarkburns @tedcruz don't have to lie about trump, he does it on his own! You just won't see it."
"@fooschamp95 @pastormarkburns @USAlivestrong you guys need to get over it, #NeverTrump because I'm a conservative,trump is not. #endofstory"
"@fooschamp95 @pastormarkburns @USAlivestrong no, I'd rather vote for the true conservative @tedcruz and if I can't, I'll write him in."
"@Skaarj_Elite @pastormarkburns @USAlivestrong I see because you say he is, I will vote for him. Lol, #NeverTrump"
"@fooschamp95 @pastormarkburns @USAlivestrong at least I'll be able to say, I did not vote for the liberal @realDonaldTrump #NeverTrump"
"@fooschamp95 @pastormarkburns @USAlivestrong I'm sick of liberals, problem is trump is one. Just running a con job on the country."
"@fooschamp95 the dems crossed over for primary, will cross back for general."
"@fooschamp95 you tell me, pro abortion, was for Obama care before he was against it, for dream act before he was against it. Conservative?"
"@kapeattsaa @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump trumps a carnival barker, used car salesman. #NeverTrump"
"@Skaarj_Elite @pastormarkburns @USAlivestrong so, you think trumps a conservative, give me a break."
"@fooschamp95 @pastormarkburns @USAlivestrong by voting trump, you assuring she gets elected.trump can't beat her, sorry, just fact."
"@kapeattsaa @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump I see you're new to Twitter, please, no one will comment to you if you don't comment on theirs"
@jimlibertarian @Stonewall_77 @mitchellvii grow up!
"@fooschamp95 @pastormarkburns @USAlivestrong you wouldn't know a conservative, you're voting trump. #NeverTrump"
"@dana_hinkley @pastormarkburns @USAlivestrong I won't be, I'm not voting for trump. #NeverTrump"
"@kapeattsaa @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump hardly. Trump isn't conservative, but keep following. #sheep #NeverTrump"
@Skaarj_Elite @pastormarkburns @USAlivestrong bite me. I'm sure you voted for Obama
"@mielewealth have a Great night, thanks for the convo."
"@mielewealth @USAlivestrong @ZarkoElDiablo @pastormarkburns @tedcruz that's how most trumpsters are. Not surprising. Pissy, just like trump"
@USAlivestrong @mielewealth @ZarkoElDiablo @pastormarkburns @tedcruz your opinion. Which isn't worth sh*t to me.
"@USAlivestrong @mielewealth @ZarkoElDiablo @pastormarkburns @tedcruz to little, to late, IMO."
@USAlivestrong @mielewealth @ZarkoElDiablo @pastormarkburns @tedcruz why would I? #NeverTrump
"@USAlivestrong back at ya, trumpster. #NeverTrump"
@USAlivestrong @mielewealth @ZarkoElDiablo @pastormarkburns @tedcruz did I say steal delegates? No. Colluded to keep Cruz down. Comprende?
@USAlivestrong not a lie. Sorry you don't believe. East to find.
@USAlivestrong @mielewealth @ZarkoElDiablo @pastormarkburns @tedcruz go read Rush Limbaugh.
@USAlivestrong @mielewealth @peachesgirli23 @ZarkoElDiablo like?
"@USAlivestrong and he got it ALL with money given to him by Daddy. He doesn't build, he just sells his name to go on it. Mr Bankrupt."
@mielewealth @USAlivestrong @peachesgirli23 @ZarkoElDiablo the wall is all they have. Trump can't point to a specific thing he will do.
@USAlivestrong @mielewealth @ZarkoElDiablo @pastormarkburns @tedcruz so did trump in Michigan.
@USAlivestrong @mielewealth @peachesgirli23 @ZarkoElDiablo following yours and trumps lead. At least @tedcruz stands for con principles.
"@USAlivestrong trump is the loser, but you chumps will still vote for him. What will he actually accomplish? Nothing. #NeverTrump"
@Bullring2 @USAlivestrong and you think we will vote for the con man trump. You are seriously deluded. Not gonna happen. #NeverTrump
"@USAlivestrong @mielewealth @peachesgirli23 @ZarkoElDiablo trump is the childish one, name calling and has zero credibility."
"@USAlivestrong if your boy doesn't get to 1237, he's not eliminated. Trump only gets a majority in democrat states. You noticed, yes?"
"@USAlivestrong @ZarkoElDiablo @pastormarkburns like you said, it eases my pain."
@mielewealth @USAlivestrong @peachesgirli23 @ZarkoElDiablo moms basement perfect for that kinda thing.
"@USAlivestrong @ZarkoElDiablo @mielewealth @pastormarkburns @tedcruz I will settle for trump not getting 1237 and then, who knows."
@PeggyBurgess17 @USAlivestrong @pastormarkburns and I'm sure you're going to post a meme to that effect.
"@USAlivestrong @ZarkoElDiablo @mielewealth @pastormarkburns @tedcruz but, you keep tweeting at me."
"@USAlivestrong @mielewealth @peachesgirli23 @ZarkoElDiablo lol, can't keep up? His was funny and true."
"@USAlivestrong @peachesgirli23 @ZarkoElDiablo @mielewealth maybe use google for trump, he has all types of neat stuff. Since your a sheep."
@USAlivestrong @ZarkoElDiablo @pastormarkburns rinse-repeat trumpster.
"@USAlivestrong @ZarkoElDiablo @mielewealth @pastormarkburns @tedcruz no, I don't know. But, neither do you. Have you asked @tedcruz"
"@mielewealth @USAlivestrong @ZarkoElDiablo @pastormarkburns now that's a FUNNY meme, and it's true."
"@ZarkoElDiablo @USAlivestrong @pastormarkburns sorry, not your babysitter, maybe you could research trump and see what you're voting for."
@USAlivestrong @ZarkoElDiablo @mielewealth @pastormarkburns you probably would have to ask him. I'm voting for @tedcruz if I have to rite in
@mielewealth thank you as well.
"@ZarkoElDiablo @USAlivestrong @pastormarkburns I have nothing to defend him for, unlike you trumpsters who have to defend him at every turn"
Making a huge mistake! Hope you can live with it. @USAlivestrong #NeverTrump  https://t.co/ZWVXphUMlf
@ZarkoElDiablo @mielewealth @USAlivestrong @pastormarkburns a vote for trump=a vote for Hillary. You trumpsters aren't very bright.
@ZarkoElDiablo @USAlivestrong @pastormarkburns you're just a little bit nuts aren't you?
@Oil_Ranger @USAlivestrong @pastormarkburns crack a book! #NeverTrump
"block and run trumpster! Can't debate, so you run and hide. #NeverTrump  https://t.co/02RUhxW2oI"
"@ZarkoElDiablo @USAlivestrong @pastormarkburns sorry don't believe in memes, good for a laugh though. #NeverTrump"
