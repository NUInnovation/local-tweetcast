"@Sweetemmilyn wow you really don't get it. DT constantly lies, this was one of many, &amp; you are excusing it. Yet ppl are tired of lying pols?"
@Sweetemmilyn https://t.co/aHY1RoNPmt &lt; DT's own words. @bloodless_coup
"@Sweetemmilyn it's not wrong to loan money, it's wrong to lie to your followers about it. A point you seem to be missing. @bloodless_coup"
"@Sweetemmilyn what that means though, is DT lied to his followers, claiming he would use his own money. @bloodless_coup"
"@Sweetemmilyn He loaned himself money, knowing donations will pay it all back. That means he has no skin in the game. @bloodless_coup"
"@seanhannity what is the difference between Trump and Hillary? Nothing. Both are NY'ers, both liars, both Dems, and in legal trouble."

"@MarieLeff @CLewandowski_ Trump calls Cruz a liar, yet the Trump camp is constantly lying just like this. If only we could sue for lying."

"@CCCINNC Seems someone is lying here, as the event was standing room only. Most likely your pic is from an hour before the event."
