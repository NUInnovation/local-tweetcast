The latest lies against Ted by Donald Trump are disgusting. Trump will not be president. #CruzCrew #Cruz2016 #TrusTED #TedCruz
Seems absolutely selfish for #Rubio and #Kasich to remain in the race.
@SarahPalinUSA Remember when you used to be a conservative?
Super Tuesday. I have a feeling it will be a good day for #TedCruz! #SuperTuesday #TedCruz2016 #TrustTed #CruzCrew #ConsistentConservative
@realDonaldTrump TWO CORINTHIANS TWO CORINTHIANS
@DLoesch Trump is going all out with lies about Ted Cruz. It's despicable.
@realDonaldTrump this is the most idiotic tweet ever. People need to wake up.
"@oreillyfactor Fox News is the reason Trump is doing so well. He is on morning, day, and night."
@RealBenCarson It might be time to perhaps explore ending your campaign
The state of the #GOP primary is frustrating. Never have I seen so many lies and so much misinformation. @tedcruz is the real #conservative.
A classy and smart move by @tedcruz to ask for Tyler's resignation. #TedCruz2016 #CruzCrew #Cruz2016
Hoping my conservative friends in SC vote for the consistent conservative! #TedCruz #CruzCrew #SCPrimary #TrustTed #SCPrimary2016 #Cruz2016
I urge all Iowans to caucus for the consistent conservative tomorrow Ted Cruz! #iacaucus #CruzCrew #IowaCaucus #TedCruz #CaucusforCruz
"@AnnCoulter Trump is afraid of Megyn Kelly, but somehow wants us to think He could handle Putin and Iran?"
"Just saw an attack ad on Cruz by a Super PAC supporting Marco Rubio, it was full of complete lies. I'd expect that from libs. @marcorubio"

"@brithume Because a majority of ""conservatives"" and republicans have no spines, and lie to their constituents."
Fantasy football? Really!? All these issues and you choose fantasy football!? @CNBC
@CNBC I am confused as to why @CarlyFiorina is closer to center than @tedcruz...
