@PaulaFeese @Anglo_Axeman @foxandfriends @jonnaspilborlaw @MichelleFields Did you read your own quote?
@Anglo_Axeman @PaulaFeese @foxandfriends @jonnaspilborlaw @MichelleFields Never said that.
@Anglo_Axeman @PaulaFeese @foxandfriends @jonnaspilborlaw @MichelleFields Unlike Trump camp her story is unwavering.
@Anglo_Axeman @PaulaFeese @foxandfriends @jonnaspilborlaw @MichelleFields I listened to her 1st accnt  sec after it happened &amp; interview.
@Anglo_Axeman @PaulaFeese @foxandfriends @jonnaspilborlaw @MichelleFields Never said that. Said she was able to manage not falling to floor.
@PaulaFeese @foxandfriends @jonnaspilborlaw @MichelleFields What was the false statement?
@foxandfriends @jonnaspilborlaw Shameful &amp; risk whiplash from all the different stories you're having to tell to sleep @ night.
@foxandfriends @jonnaspilborlaw Wasn't about being tough. Was about the smear campaign Trump put out discrediting @MichelleFields account.

@megynkelly should be commended for allowing truth to be told on behalf of @MichelleFields by @benshapiro. #KellyFile provided fair stage.
@MichelleFields is fortunate to have @benshapiro as a friend. He represented her position fiercely on #KellyFile &amp; exposed Trump thugs!

Trump is right. He's a jobs creator- the legal field. &amp; outreach's impressive: Corey's attorney wasn't highly employable bc of tussy biting.
Are we sure Lewandowski lied to Trump? https://t.co/YnAnxlPCrU
