"@JaysonMoriarty @AnaheimDucks Actually, Freddie is getting released as a free agent, no trade &amp; frankly, Gibson is a quite inferior choice"
@BoSnerdley @nypost So sad to hear @GovPenceIN isn't so pro-constitution as he has projected in the past. #INPrimary #tcot #tlot #ccot #Cruz
"@JaysonMoriarty @AnaheimDucks Did you hear what he said?: ""this will not be the same team, that's for sure."" But, he's keeping Gibson???"
@AnaheimDucks Many fans are wondering when will there be a serious evaluation of Murray as many of his decisions have had a negative effect.
"@HockeyJr8 @UnknownDucksFan Oh, not at all! Freddie was solid. Yes, D didn't do their job. Wld be dif game if ref'g in 1st had been fair."
"@UnknownDucksFan I wouldn't put that past Murray. Let's see, who lost our 2 first home games? But, we do need good solid goal tending. SadðŸ˜”"

"@PennyHicks13 @brewer_pam any yayoo can say those things, but the proof is in the pudding: DT has been funding 4yrs what's created th prob."
".@AnaheimDucks 3rd period, for 3 goals!!! #LetsGoDucks"
@JudgeJeanine oh!!! Give me a break!!! Is this why you've been drooling over every nonsensical thing that drips out of DTs mouth
@seanhannity @JeannaEckert @realDonaldTrump NOOOOOOO!!!!!
@BoSnerdley @DesBieler WOW!! Now we all know how ignorant #Knight is about our nation's history. So sadly typical.
