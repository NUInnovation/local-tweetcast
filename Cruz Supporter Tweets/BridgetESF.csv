@ballGame89 @DavidLimbaugh @tedcruz @jrfiocca They came to him. He didn't change his platform to woo GOPe support.
"@ballGame89 @DavidLimbaugh @LibertyIndigo This sifted through voters who don't engage in the process, showed flaws in Trump's campaign."
@ballGame89 @DavidLimbaugh @LibertyIndigo They didn't want to be controlled by national GOP. People who paid attention had no problem.
@ballGame89 @DavidLimbaugh @LibertyIndigo The state GOP changed their rules in August but they did it so they could have unbound delegates.
