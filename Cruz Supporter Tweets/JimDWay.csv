@oreillyfactor is angry and defensive like his boy Trump because he is guilty and knows Fox News ratings are down! https://t.co/Jka5LaZ79H
This is what we are asking for by nominating Trump. https://t.co/ybwS2GzK4H
That is why we need him! #cruzcrew  https://t.co/xDFSMhTcZ1
@seanhannity All in for Trump no matter what -- All Trump all the time - even interviewing @tedcruz  https://t.co/JaF15eix5V
@seanhannity @BillOReilyTV @foxandfriends @greta  This is what it has become! https://t.co/NN1BH2yC7b
"Thank you, Sean.  That sounded like the ""old"" Sean we all loved.   https://t.co/oQMItra8oU"
@rushlimbaugh Pence endorsement says nice things about all candidates for unity sake. He is clear about his preference!
"@seanhannity  I have been looking for your tweet about Pence endorsing Ted Cruz. Not news to you, I guess. If he endorsed DT you would!"
I knew to keep your job and friends at Fox you would have to downplay the YUGE endorsement today.  Sad for you. https://t.co/3ST1DEFQFn
"As @MichaelBerrySho said, Hope it wasn't at factory that makes Trump ties, right Ann? https://t.co/I53Oh2z1h4"
"Enough said about who the ""establishment insider"" is! https://t.co/WSolntoBOF"
"Mafia, hired thugs, and on and on it goes for Trump!  Intimidation and bullying all the way with @DRUDGE_REPORT  https://t.co/vCkL6k3knM"
"Again, not the point. Sean can support anyone - has every right to do so. He SAYS he is equally fair to all.  Not! https://t.co/tS6mvaX2mx"
Reagan was a conservative and did not mute it at all.  His honest conservatism won 2 landslides! https://t.co/n8lzxm7WQQ
I do not CLAIM to have no bias.  The false claim is the issue. https://t.co/DzRYmcfHFy
And Trump's universal healthcare paid by the govt is going to reduce the debt?  He has many fooled. https://t.co/iR7hFNGe1N
Trump or Hillary?  Sides of the same coin.  Trump has always helped finance her campaigns. https://t.co/X7UoYRVqT1
Then he should admit it. https://t.co/wCmfMTzX3V
"No, I fear they are deceived like the Trump University students.  You should be about issues not a leader to follow. https://t.co/ms1poOM4CE"
Surely you Trumpers can do better than repeat Trump's mantras like mind-numbed robots.  Learn issues to discuss. https://t.co/wEpV3p4EWt
Let me type slowly for you Trumpers. The issue is NOT if Sean has a tight to endorse. It is his CLAIM of neutrality. https://t.co/Vk5XcHazAy
What a debater you are! Name calling and being upset that someone expresses opposite views from Trump.  How dare Ted https://t.co/aKIV8jkPVv
Calm down.  You missed the point.  Sean claims to be neutral.  He is free to support whomever he likes.  https://t.co/nBdH6AOZpU
