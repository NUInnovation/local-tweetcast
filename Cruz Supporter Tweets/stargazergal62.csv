@SteveDeaceShow @Ma1973sk @GOP  Trump has also said Hillary would make a good president.
@DeanClancy @RealBPhil Awesome!   Thank you.
@EWErickson Prayers to you and your family.
Because it's true.... https://t.co/cgg3FWSLEs
@JonahNRO @hunkerdad Loved The Young Ones!
@Saint_Obama @RonaldGorr1 @tyvickie22 @ldillardj @megynkelly @heidiscruz @tedcruz He  has the best words and a great brain...
@derekahunter @politico Someone better tell Carson...
When lies are reported as facts.... https://t.co/CJ3AA9A5lT
@NewDay4America @healthandcents And Trump called Iowans stupid...
@BradThor @hotairblog I'm actually surprised his favorable rating is that high with women.
@soshable @Saint_Obama Next it will be a Snickers bar with a fork and knife.
"@benshapiro @realDonaldTrump Says the candidate with the lowest negatives.  From those numbers,  no one likes Trump."
@Saint_Obama @Mischief2You How this man has any female supporters is beyond me. Must be a type of battered women's syndrome.
@SteveDeaceShow Wish I had that last hour of my life back. It was like an accident. I couldn't look away.
"I feel like I'm sitting next to the drunkest, loudmouth in the bar at closing time."
@Oldguyintheboon @SteveDeaceShow @MZHemingway I'm not that gullible.
@trscoop @tedcruz I can feel the greatness of America once again when Cruz speaks. #CruzCrew
@SteveDeaceShow @MZHemingway I'm embarrassed watching. Feel like my IQ is dropping.
Did Trump just say it was fine to have a nation that acts like 5 year olds?
"@AdamBaldwin @realDonaldTrump Can't be very high if he doesn't know what ""touch"" is."
@amandacarpenter @trscoop Can't imagine why any self respecting woman would like a misogynist like Trump.
He is Risen.  Happy Easter to all. https://t.co/oNH3vLHuWj
@SteveDeaceShow @allahpundit That's something I wouldn't admit to.
@BradThor @politico He has a copy of the Obamas divorce papers too....
@HarrietBaldwin @realDonaldTrump @11phenomenon Trump does project his shortcomings onto others.
"@Saint_Obama @CarolVicic @freddoso IF it becomes necessary, let's do a write in campaign."
@DocThompsonShow @realDonaldTrump Trump will do anything so he doesn't have to talk about real issues.
"@Saint_Obama @CarolVicic @freddoso If Cruz isn't the nominee, I go third party. Most likely Constitution party."
@Saint_Obama @CNN We all will sleep much better with Ted as president.
@Saint_Obama @CNN So very beautiful.
@sylvanrodriguez @heidiscruz @tedcruz Beautiful family!  Would be so very proud to have them in the White House.
@BradThor @Talkmaster Hillary might not get a pass like Obama. Not that I want her as president.  Definitely don't want Trump as president.
@DavidLimbaugh @LeslieL76 Don't know that HRC will get the same pass Obama has gotten. Depends how far gone the Republican party is....
@tedcruz @realDonaldTrump And why did you say she'd make a good president?
@ArantheGreat @healthandcents @DanScavino I'm guessing Trump and Walker are in the right hand column that's out of frame.
"@BradThor  If this is what his candidacy is like, think what his presidency would be like.   #NeverTrump"
@Saint_Obama @VanJones68 @realDonaldTrump Would someone explain to me how a man that seemingly ignorant is considered the winner in polls?
@Debber66 @DineshDSouza Voting for the lesser evil is STILL voting for evil.  #NeverTrump
@Saint_Obama  Awesome!
I love seeing these moments.... https://t.co/yvZSDqx6wF
@benshapiro And yet he sounds like a guy in the bar around closing time.
A vote for Trump in the primary is a vote for Clinton in the general election. #NeverTrump   #ChooseCruz
"""@marklevinshow: Limbaugh: Cruz took on establishment, Trump and others won't https://t.co/T0x8PnIVHA"" #ChooseCruz"
@MattWalshBlog Same here. Sad part is RNC will say Trump was too right wing and push for someone even more left leaning next time. smh
I did my part in Iowa. Super Tuesday states it's your turn now! #ChooseCruz
America deserves better. #NeverTrump
"@el_jebe @Bidenshairplugs  I am NOT loyal to a party. Regardless of which party he is with at the moment, I wouldn't vote for him."
@el_jebe @Bidenshairplugs @kerpen  Good for you then. Trump belongs in the Dem party.
"@el_jebe @Bidenshairplugs @kerpen  If Trump was running as a Dem saying the EXACT same things, would you support him?"
@kerpen @Bidenshairplugs  Not being a sore loser. I will not vote for a progressive.
"@BradThor  Plus by his own account, he is part of the 1%."
@El__Bohemio @BradThor  And you wake up with him the next morning full of shame and regret...
"@mykulu_theCorgi @MarkSimoneNY  I was talking about Trump, https://t.co/Dbj4zXiO8H"
@MarkSimoneNY  I don't believe anyone with such high negatives has been elected President either.
@DaTechGuyblog @ElBuehn @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Isn't that about half of what the polls indicated?
"@NolteNC  If everyone who said Cruz is their guy, but voting Trump for electability would vote for Cruz, Ted would win."
"@BradThor @Reince @GOP If Trump is the nominee, America loses."
@BradThor @GOP  You got my vote!
"@BradThor  If Trump is the nominee, I will vote 3rd party. Most likely Constitutional party."
@AdamBaldwin  Glenn said Scalia's death was a wake-up call for America.  He never mentioned Cruz.
"Merry Christmas to all.
