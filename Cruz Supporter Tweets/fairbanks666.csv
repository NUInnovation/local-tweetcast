@gerfingerpoken @IBDeditorials we need more good guys with guns.
@gerfingerpoken2 I wish.  Watch she skates on everything.
@MariaBartiromo @nytimes Don't blame Cruz because you have New York values.
@FNC_Ladies_Rule @KatTimpf @MariaBartiromo I don't care for Maria Bartiromo's new York values.
"@barstoolsports @KatTimpf How does this young ""lady"" plan on functioning in the real world?"
@AndreaTantaros @nypost I heard that FOX dumped you!  Say it ain't so!
"@colavs2184 @Cruzing7777 @ChrisMusgr4 @ericbolling I like Cruz, but he lost the race."
@brithume Cruz needs to gracefully bow out.  Kasich needs to go as well.
"@SheriffClarke Hillary would say that rioting is healthy and ""empowers"" them."
"@BlissTabitha Cruz is merely playing hardball, something Trump needs to do to win in November."
@interstingfact2 @gproblems04 why wasn't there teachers like her when I was in school?
@FoxNews @JohnKasich @HillaryClinton @TeamCavuto John Kasich is a Democrat.  That's why he beats Hillary.
@JohnFromCranber @AKC0G that is what I've been saying all along.
@PatriotBrother @gunluvngal @GaetaSusan @JVER1 @ChristieC733 @LoriKemp @JAmy208 @LeahR77 @DrSueDVM @WestxgalAmen! @andieiamwhoiam
@ReporterClaudia @eaaknighterrant @KNX1070 I thought that sort of thing was legal in California.
"@realDonaldTrump when you are elected president, don't let us down."
@CO2HOG @CarmineZozzora @rcpvideo Pete King and kasich are both Democrats.
@rae_etrigan1701 that's ridiculous.
@ultraconcept @DrMartyFox repeal the 16th amendment and you can abolish it.
@NaughtyBeyotch I haven't trusted the media for a score now.
@RedNationRising @MarketWatch they're all on welfare.
@BraveConWarrior Bring it on.  I'm ready. https://t.co/juVyxuK655
@warriorwoman91 Cruz is absolutely right.
@2AFightR obama is a lying POS.
@RebellionReport I'm with you.  I'm willing to join you.
@RebellionReport I totally agree with you.
@KennedyNation take care of yourself.
@gerfingerpoken obama and Hillary are quite willing to stand by and allow China to amass power.
"@joyreaper sounds like ""New York values"" at work.  What a pity."
@prison_boss @FoxNews @Princeton Watters is exposing idiots.
@AndreaTantaros @politico Does obama understand anything?
@ConcealNCarryNt We are all going to be burned. https://t.co/Vh958JazO4
"@ConcealNCarryNt it just keeps getting worse, doesn't it?"
@warriorwoman91 @DailyCaller I'll believe Hillary is indicted when I see it.
@gerfingerpoken2 All part of obama's plan.
@KennedyNation @friedmeyer_mike @ScottLovelace3 you watch basketball?
@JaredWyand Chris Kyle was a true American hero.
@tlilje1 @LindaSuhler @ResistTyranny @ChristiChat the GOP has been dying a slow death for about 16 years now.
"@BrouwerClaire @LodiSilverado @ChristiChat if the GOP tries to block Trump, it will become a joke."
@yojudenz @NaughtyBeyotch @BarracudaMama https://t.co/Zg67JJXBhO
@jstines3 you're too late.
@LodiSilverado @ChristiChat That would destroy republican credibility.
"@ResistTyranny @ChristiChat if GOP tries to stop Trump, that will be the end of it."
@gerfingerpoken idiot Governor.
@surfermom77 @LeahR77 https://t.co/6aVT3xu48Q
@ArcticFox2016 Islam was never peaceful.  Ask Charles Martell.
@gerfingerpoken2 Hillary sickens me.
@gerfingerpoken they knew what the job involved when they took it.
@Conservative_VW does anybody still go to see his movies?
@RedRising11 @Callisto1947 @AmmoLand that's awesome!
@TwitterSurveys feel free to contact me anytime.
"@KarenDoe50 @KirstenPowers she is nice to look at, but the minute she opens her mouth the fantasy dies."
@baileyjer @BreitbartNews they got what they deserved.
@Law1781 @DvensC @aliciaciccone @shaker0309 I am the NRA.  And I am freedom's safest place.
@jlmclin @ctrlaltnope @NBCNews justice is coming. https://t.co/jIKh2B4DPK
@ctrlaltnope @NBCNews rednecks are sick of watching you guys turn America into in big ghetto.
"@NBCNews we're bitter, angry Americans and we're coming after you."
"@linda_kling @KatTimpf I like her.  If my cat were a person, she'd be like KatTimpf."
Everyone wondering who would want to vote for Trump need to ask who would want to vote for obama.
@realDonaldTrump watch out for protestors.
@jack_jdcagle I agree.  Fight the establishment!
Professional troublemakers blocking Trump supporters from rallies.  This isn't going to end well.
@DrMartyFox Kasich needs a frontal lobotomy.
@Leslie_Waters why NO Trump?
@Leslie_Waters Why NO Trump?
@FunnyFloyd88 @FowlerSarah whatever
@FunnyFloyd88 @FowlerSarah obama's wrecked the country.  That's doing his job?
@FowlerSarah @NPR the next President will pick the supreme Court justice.  End of story.
"@NahBabyNah @BuzzFeedNews Kasich won Ohio, big deal!  Both Trump and Cruz clobber him in the delegate count."
@gerfingerpoken2 @DRUDGE he will start a civil war.
@chuckwoolery Kasich doesn't have a chance.
"@PoliticalLaughs they're all jerks, but Trump might win."
@foxandfriends Dems run Michigan but blame Pubs.
@PatriotVote2016 good luck with that.
@AnnCoulter @ThePatriot143 You are my hero!
"@TracyAChambers @BobG231 @BreitbartNews somewhere, Charlie Crist is smiling."
@1Tomalco @LeahR77 I've got relatives in Ohio and they love Kasich.  They're all dems though.
@nathanielbumpo @SharonMcCutchan @vdare he should be competing against Hillary and Bernie.
@vdare Kasich doesn't have a republican bone in his body.
@gerfingerpoken @IBDeditorials perjury doesn't matter to Hillary.
@PatriotVote2016 not a Democrat?  Not a Republican?  You can't get elected!
@PoliticalLaughs very well said.
"@glennbeck I don't like Trump, but he's better than Hillary."
@Gcooper0625 @SurvivorMed who do I avoid? Democrats!
"@Budd0427 @ewray5 Kasich is a Democrat, thru and thru."
@WDFx2EU @CalFreedomMom @HillaryClinton @ToTheXToTheY there's a chapter of the Klan in California?
@seanhannity @JohnKasich Kasich doesn't have a republican bone in his body.
@GretchenInOK @gwfrazee @dcexaminer all part of his plan to destroy America.
@Judianna @Will_Antonin what will you do for 30 pieces of silver?
@ArcticFox2016 And that's supposed to help?
@BurtsBees I HATE BEES!
@GeraldoRivera @TheWrap @DancingABC appearing on Dancing with the stars?  You've lost any credibility you had.
I'm tired of people saying Trump can't win when the polls clearly say otherwise.
@JulieBorowski I love the taste of coffee.  I also love the taste of beer and Jack Daniels.
@realDonaldTrump that's embarrassing for Kasich.
@Harmanjitsihgh1 @jjauthor @yo need to start carrying firearms for protection.
@AnnLillianBond @SharonMcCutchan @BreitbartNews they're terrified of a Trump presidency.
@JackFire  I've been a Jack Daniels fan for over 30 years.
Watching all the entertainment on the presidential election.
"@cbirobin @TeamTrumpAZ @loudobbsnews @DanScavino Kasich is a Democrat, thru and thru."
"@TeamTrumpAZ @FiveRights @DanScavino the more they protest, the more popular he becomes."
@AndreaTantaros I wish he would go away.
@michaelkeyes @abitx2u I agree.
@JohnFromCranber @DrMartyFox @BreitbartNews obama pretends at a lot of things.
@loudobbsnews @realDonaldTrump the GOP needs to accept Trump.
"@KennedyNation @ComicDaveSmith @BenKissel @KirstenHaglund the tea party started as a libertarian group, but was invaded by christians."
