"@HallieJackson @MSNBC @tedcruz if turned around &amp; this was trump, he would insult the man &amp; have his security rough him up. #trumpnoclass"
@toddstarnes you mean liberal democrats and trump supporters.
@toddstarnes whitmore has clearly crossed line and can be sued for defamation. Not funny.
@ReaganWorld @elaimy55 @thehill meth is a terrible drug.
@stephenfhayes @seanhannity I'd stay home. Like many can stomach Hillary over trump. Both suck ass but why are those only choices. Not yet.
@amandacarpenter @RareTrumpSteak apparently you have to look like a meth/crack whore to be spokeswoman for trump. Amanda does fit.
"@RVD1117 @RapSheet true, thought Bradford had most value in trade. He's a bad penny."
@RVD1117 @RapSheet right. I was hoping they would trade Bradford and at least get a second round pick. Guess stuck with him at least a yr.üò¢
@theblaze all these female trump mouthpieces look like crack whores. Annoying to nth degree.
@RVD1117 @RapSheet made me tear up a bit. Need to get rid of loser Bradford.
@PHLEaglesNation Kelly trying to ruin another's team for future. üò¢
"@TheFive show unwatchable. Two meathead trump leg jumpers, a cheap whore trump lover. Sickening. üëéüèªüí©"
"@ericbolling @FoxNews you are a moron, meat head asshole. Get off your knees and gets trump's dick out your mouth."
@eagles_fanly ? What toughness. Learning to be ok with losing.
"@eagles_fanly Bradford is a baby, and a loser. Trade that bum. I'd trade him for a pack of gum, just get rid of him."
"@EaglesFnPg please take him, please."
"@TheLibertyLogan since Rubio says he won't be a vp, Kasich too, she's good pick. No one out there to help him more in battleground states."
@HallieJackson @tedcruz that goal is much higher than 10 feet.
@TheLibertyLogan you can't lose what you never had. üòâ
@PetaJensen good to here. Wish you all the best in future. Good luck üòÄüëçüèª
@theblaze trumpkins are so stupid. Like their umpa lumpa cult leader.
@eagles_fanly trade the loser if you could find anyone who wants him. Doubtful. Should have never resigned him.
@TheLibertyLogan all but Rush have shown how liberal and idiotic they are.
@Super70sSports Starsky ruled. üëçüèª
@SPORTalkFlyers why did they have to lose 3 games before they changed power play defense up to more aggressive defense? To late?
@FrankLuntz @realDonaldTrump wrong. He'll get 49%. 67 delegates. He always underperforms the polls.
@charlescwcooke @TheFix says establishment hack writer. Ha. Cruz can beat her easy.
@mishacollins he may get Hillary's support now too. üòÇ
@zesty_politics nasa Does more lying. Sad.
@DLoesch more evidence of their trump favoritism botching Cruz's speech audio. Terrible.
@megynkelly @ParksDj @tedcruz fox showing its trump favoritism in their purposeful incompetence by botching sound of Cruz's speech. Terrible
"@BuckSexton Bernie, Hillary doesn't know what a broom is."
@TooCuteAnimals who doesn't?
@jaketapper true. Spoiled petulant child too.
@jaketapper @jasoncarrollcnn he ain't lying.
@EliotShorrParks I'm on your side on signing Bradford. Rather play Daniels.
"@EliotShorrParks if only you had a say, resigning Bradford was a waist."
@EliotShorrParks @TylerJustin4 will not happen. Bradford proven he is a loser.
@EliotShorrParks @pflynn20 Bradford won't be. He's not capable.
"@eagles_fanly if pederson was banging a 20yr old I say way to go. As for Andy Reid, fuck him. He's a loser."
@iamdeeza2 @realDonaldTrump stop being weak minded. Your safe space is your delusion. Sad.
@iamdeeza2 @realDonaldTrump why shit on America and Captain America like this? Sickening.
@HallieJackson @realDonaldTrump excuses of a loser.
@Morning_Joe its sad &amp; embarrassing seeing these lib NY media types trying to suck own dick &amp; lick own pussies about how great NY is.üëéüèª
@Morning_Joe room of idiots and their moron cult leader. üí©
@Morning_Joe @NYDailyNews proves truth of New York values. City of shit. üëéüèª liberal hacks.
