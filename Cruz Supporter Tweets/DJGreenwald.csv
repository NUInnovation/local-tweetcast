@alsabido33 PS his points are good. He means almost none of it!
@alsabido33 @realDonaldTrump You shouldn't. I'm fed up with GOP too. Trump is taking advantage of people's anger. Read A Time For Truth.
@alsabido33 Because Albert Trump is a liberal just like Hillary. His recent conservative Rhetoric is just an act fed to him by his handlers.
@Time4Courage Point taken but it's not that clear. Having lived through Schwarzenegger in CA liberals get what they want &amp; still blame GOP.
This true even if Trump wins the general election. #UniTED #Cruz2016 https://t.co/lnKHq7Hff6
@Time4Courage lying about being conservative works for you though?
