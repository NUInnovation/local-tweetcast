@MrDane1982 they really do - think he's the messiah
"@SDzzz Obama speaks the truth -- Bernie did not vote until he ran for office, he says"
@artist4ever @DrJillStein she's a loon -- sounds like someone needs to start informing people
@MattyPGood @fawfulfan @buffsblg hardly -- pd 's job is to defend properly - how can she not question accuser's veracity?
@mhnjva @BumpItMcCarthy @rntaylor1963 @buffsblg @albyselkie @fawfulfan @RoughDraft360 bs - did not have the lefty trolls support Obama
@SarahKSilverman you are helping to perpetuate a con
@JesseLehrich ha ha ha ha ha ðŸ˜‚
@jdvanlaningham @WindyDane I would not have said it
@jdvanlaningham @WindyDane you are right
@Kimberly124 @jkfecke @SeanMcElwee who will be next on Donald Trump's hit list?  is anybody safe?
@JoyAnnReid @thepoliticalcat good!!
@aravosis @JustAGurLnSwedn what do expect from that idiot
@cdelbrocco @jonfavs they are all about click bait
@WindyDane @jdvanlaningham @CathyWentzel Barney Frank is honorable man who will follow the people's wishes
@SFL4Hillary yup - and GOP already has a turnout problem for down ticket races
@bromoore well I'm with beck on that - wow
@Gus_802 probably true but he was the one elected Prez
@bannerite @Toure not all but far too many - they are destroying the good he has done - but it always starts at the top
@ahumorlessfem @SusanDanzig219 @AlanKestrel750 but Bernie is not that kind of man - never has been - deadbeat dad kind of guy
@Karoli @RiskyLiberal I wonder if he realizes who actually holds a lot of that debt?
"@KevinDarryl @BlueNationRev if the GOP is to be a party for good in this country, they need to run far away from Trump"
@KevinDarryl @BlueNationRev Trump has no clue -- just a name-caller
@BealsParrish @berylmills455 and hopefully Bernie too
@BerniedOut blocked her awhile ago - nasty
"@utliberal @maddow @brianstelter @BernieSanders corporations sell to liberals too -- FOX is free most places, MSNBC premium channel"
@Africanfighter @RalstonReports it's all about aggrievement - like Trump - not our shared causes for the country
@gigglebits11 @stylistkavin @SFL4Hillary worse part is Bernie defends it - did on Rachel Maddow tonight
@MattMurph24 well Bernie should quit bringing his campaign into the gutter and start building an organization - if he can
@dhaakenson @BenJealous super delegates are not allocated by state - they are national
@SopanDeb @richardwolffedc this man belongs nowhere near the White House
@YupThatExist @raulita totally awesome
@KaydeeKing @Madaza41 @E2Tha @PaulMadrigal099 @lhfang please tell us what he has done then
@E2Tha @PaulMadrigal099 @lhfang ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
@neochinaski @gdebenedetti exactly -- voter suppression that worked out fairly well for Sanders so guess he'll keep them - hypocrite
@maddow @BernieSanders why did you give this man a full hour - he is done and conning his supporters
"@maddow @BernieSanders well, duh, Bernie was a back-bencher socialist, just became a Dem and over 3 million votes behind&amp;off 300 pledged"
"@maddow @BernieSanders @HillaryClinton oh please -- they are endorsing, that's all -- its only not fair because they did not pick u"
@maddow @BernieSanders well that is only because they are his primary source of delegates -- clearly they r vote suppression on steroids
@maddow @BernieSanders no it is not when they are making little kids cry and using foul language
@maddow @BernieSanders he needs to stop the harassment of Clinton supporters at her rallies - it's out of control
@utliberal @maddow @brianstelter @BernieSanders MSNBC tried to do that after Olberman's success but did not make enough money at it
@stellaaaa yup - Bernie is doing serious damage to liberal/progressive causes at this point
"@brianknewhouse @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump go follow your serial loser DT - 3 marriages, 4 bankruptcies"
@prettyplusmore @elizabethforma @NewWestSandy no - it's all DT understands -- not a speck of mud on her
@maryannmarlowe @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump I would love it but I think Warren can do more in the Senate
@2sense2 @tlwtexas @danspence2006 sore loser
@jwielandward why oh why -- what a scumbag
@joshtpm I think she is going to be a dynamite surrogate for Hillary!
@finneyk so sorry Karen - no doubt he was equally as proud of you
@FluentsWorld @IamPhreedah you are totally misinformed or lying
@stellaaaa where in hell are these people getting such lies
@JoyAnnReid there's no road too low for him and his deluded supporters
@EricBoehlert mysoginy at work
@thepoliticalcat @art2u2 @maddow @BernieSanders except he's in Vermont?  Why there?
@thehill sorry Bernie -- it's called smart politics and you know it
"@aravosis @thehill he's recruited GOP to the 'DEMS', why can't she?  Oh right she's not Bernie who walks on water"
@cherokeesher2 @MSNBC @maddow @BernieSanders can't watch -- I'm afraid Rachel will wimp out
