@chrismoranimal instincts tell me that it was Greinke who provoked the visit
@bradweimer learned from the best just give me the why it happened in with three reasons or less.  Had to be proud of the maze
@CeeDotA past history and Greinke said something to him.  They have faced each other what 20 times?? They clearly were not fans of each othr
Don't understand the hostility towards Quentin.  If he Greinke hits him and breaks hand Carlos misses 8 weeks and Greinke has a pr on 1b?
