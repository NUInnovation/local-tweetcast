"Once he annoys China and they call in their loan from the US, the banks will call in their loans. Disaster. https://t.co/pWOhIAGXd9"
Does anything intelligent ever come out his mouth? https://t.co/8uhKI7BgjI
When you vote for an idiot you get what you deserve. https://t.co/uBo2gvHPFq
I guess you had better start by bringing your own business back to the US. https://t.co/RGhnxAuy1c
Bizarre statements from bizarre people. https://t.co/IE8McJOFyu
They will just call in their big loan from US. Banks will call in their loans etc. Better get your house paid off. https://t.co/UVwWcYBK9S
World War 3? https://t.co/kZdLnO4xMN
Don't give up. https://t.co/G0rh87WQ9b
Not everyone following Trump is a fan. https://t.co/um6D3074Zf
Unbelievable https://t.co/vxky37GRZd
Disgusting https://t.co/8Eht8497HS

I wonder what his IQ is. https://t.co/l8u8vdK4o3
They must have a psychological test for prospective presidents. He is nuts. https://t.co/jnma7tshog
He is getting desperate. https://t.co/RMP9zhhk6U
He needs a new mirror. https://t.co/1cWV379apy
Time to get these big mouths off the trail. https://t.co/P13JDJNkBE
