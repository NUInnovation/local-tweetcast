Happy birthday to my good friend @andersonstevem you're an amazing friend to have and I hope all your birthday wishes come true. Lot of love
"With Vicki's OTT reaction, I don't think the housewives believe Brooks has cancer. #RHOC"
"God, I can't stand Vicki. She's attacking Meghan for caring, but Vicki is defensive about Brooks cancer. Maybe he doesn't have any. #RHOC"
"By far, the best act of the night. #AGT"
I'm starting to believe that Vicki and Brooks made up this cancer thing to give a him story and get air time. #RHOC
"Vicki's getting pretty defensive, like Tamra says - either Brooks isn't sick or she's a good actress. #RHOC"
Really Heather? 14 bathrooms? Your closet is big as someone's apartment. Wow. #RHOC
@Triwidow50 Hope she gets help and find happiness again.
"If Shannon's kids see their mom being unhappy, and she keeps dwelling on it - why not divorce David? #RHOC"
Love Freckled Sky. #AGT
Can't wait for next weeks episode. Megan finally tells Vickie off. Can't wait for that! #RHOC
"Hey Shannon, that's why they make depends. You should wear them. #RHOC"
"Maybe Brooks has been playing Vickie all this time about his illness. If he is, he's one sick asshole. #RHOC"
Its shocking what the physic said about Brooks not having cancer. Who knows? He comes across as very shady. #RHOC
"Jim and Megan are right, Vickie should mind her own business. #RHOC"
Wow Samantha! She made that song her own and it could be released as a single right now. Amazing voice! #AGT
"Terry was the No. 1 ventriloquist, but Paul is second. If Paul wins, Terry has competition. #AGT"
Ben did amazing! Love him! #AGT
"Siro-A was amazing, that would be a great act for Vegas. #AGT"
#HBDPatty hope your day is filled with love and happiness. @Patty_Mills ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽˆðŸŽ‚
How can anyone trust Tamera and tell her anything? She'll turn around and tell the other housewives. That's what she did last year. #RHOC
It looks and it seems like they're attacking Megan. All because of her step kids. #RHOC
"Can't stand Vickie, wish she would mind her own business and leave Megan alone. #RHOC"
"There goes Vickie and Tamera, stirring the pot again. Jealous bitches. #RHOC"
RIP Frank Gifford. My condolences and prayers are with Kathy Lee and her family.
Happy birthday @DavidtheAdmiral - hope you have a blessed day. #SpursNation
@JacksonSars I remember Vickie treating Lizzie bad last year. Now she's doing it to Megan. Maybe she's jealous because they're younger.
@JacksonSars Agreed!
Shannon and Megan are my favorite housewives. #RHOC
"Its good to see the girls having fun for a change. Touching boobs, swimming etc. #RHOC"
Can't stand Vickie. She exaggerates about everything! Wish she gave Megan a chance. #RHOC
"I just love Shannon, I think she's funny talking about her ""deflated balloons."" ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ #RHOC"
I wish Vickie and Tamera would cut Megan some slack. At least she loves her step kids. #RHOC
Happy birthday @manuginobili ðŸŽˆðŸŽ‚ love you! Hope all your wishes come true.
Happy birthday @manuginobili - hope all your wishes come true! #SpursNation
So Shannon has judgy eyes? That was funny. #RHOC
@Caitlyn_Jenner You look stunning! My favorite picture is of you in the car. You look prettier than Kris. Wish you luck &amp; be happy!
