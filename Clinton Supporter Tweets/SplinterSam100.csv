@Jade_Skyee Omg Seriously really why would they rate you badly well I guess people are stupid and blind if they don't find you Hot as HELL
@lokiriko No nothing to be Sorry about your streamed almost 4 Hours and so much fun different games Sometimes you have those days gonna B Ok
@Arabella_Fae owh sorry did not see
@Arabella_Fae and could you make a dissission what laptop you would want to buy?
@Arabella_Fae Noorl Not sleep Forever I Still think that your natural collor is the most beautiful
@Arabella_Fae I would Buy this Laptop if you want to use it for Multimedia and things  Asus N552VX Or if want Ultra tin ASUS UX305CA-FC022T
@Arabella_Fae And Portable? and you could not use it as a Gaming/Editing Laptop?
@Arabella_Fae Heey Ari Found 2 really good Laptop`s but what is more important too you Battary and change`sable things or Very light..
@i_blame_aliens Lolz i thought that it would only be used at Home :P But i Found a really good Laptop
@Arabella_Fae @i_blame_aliens But I get what your saying gonna look for the perfect Pc Setup
@Arabella_Fae @i_blame_aliens But can't you be a Camgirl with a Hugh Gaming Desktop Pc üòÇ xD
@SophieMilzink Jij Ook üòç

@Arabella_Fae @i_blame_aliens But why would you wanna do that?  You can Make a Whole CAM room With a Hugh Pc Setup right?
@i_blame_aliens Why would she wanna do that it's for Show's @Home right? Is a Normal Pc not More Bang for your Buck?
@Arabella_Fae @i_blame_aliens Or You need to Buy a All in One PC that's also very capable hardware and Hugh screen but very light
@i_blame_aliens But Laptops are More expensive in the Long run and you cannot change parts and stand alone Webcam's are usually better
@Arabella_Fae Braces are Important but A New Desktop Pc is Something like your Lifeline Income so I would go for that Your still Amazing
@i_blame_aliens  @Arabella_Fae Don't buy a Laptop Just buy a Desktop it's much cheaper and is something breaks you can easily replace it

@Arabella_Fae @Alice_XII No buy One Desktop pc and spent some money on it than you know it keeps working for the commig years

@Arabella_Fae @shapman88oncb @i_blame_aliens If you want I can Mail my Pc Set up to you if you want it has to be a whole lot cheaper now
@Arabella_Fae The Intel i5 6600 I got in my Gaming Pc and it works like a beast also got 16 gig memory and a Intel GTX 970 I'm very happy
@Arabella_Fae The Only Thing I would change is the Intel Core i7 in a Core i5 it's cheaper and works just as Fine
