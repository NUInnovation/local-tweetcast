How do you say goodbye to something when you don't wanna let them go😢
Is there more to life than this?

@amywinehause_ More like homework lol
@Ms_Yom1 Did not know that either. Very interesting
@melaniealbor Agreed. Not all families are the same but should be treated equally.
Can't believe love doesn't exist 2 some anymore so they decide to mail in their wives. To me that's like human trafficking #Family #SOCL3310
"""Blood Ties"" is not what makes a family. Unconditional love respect &amp; care for one another. Blood relation shouldn't matter#family #SOCL3310"
