@Omojuwa @cocopampam and she aimed perfectly. How many lives was he trying to ruin again? She's the superwoman here.
@Omojuwa @MrAbuSidiq that's how little they see themselves. See why their party got it wrong?
@Tee_blaq @Omojuwa and then he gets another gun or knife depending on how patient he gets. #RIP
@Omojuwa Essential sense you meant. Commonsense is going too far.
@Omojuwa @TheShowOff85 Why blame TIWA?  I thought a drug infuse idiot ranted wanting to blame everyone but himself for his idiocy
@OgbeniDipo @Omojuwa @benmurraybruce Mr. Bruce I couldn't agree less. Can you walk the talk and ensure your circle of influence do same?
@Omojuwa @cocopampam @Ezebunaf4 So he can go brazing and she can't? I think she was a lot civil about it all too not with all he wrote
