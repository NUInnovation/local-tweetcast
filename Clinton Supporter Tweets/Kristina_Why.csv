@NicoleJeanLTL @PattiFink @GomezReporting  2/2 so I cld vote in primaries bcuz I know it's SO important this time. We must not let an R b P.
@NicoleJeanLTL @PattiFink @GomezReporting Yep! I actually had 2 reregistered as a Dem this election 1/2
@NicoleJeanLTL @PattiFink @GomezReporting Honestly the record reflects Dems have rewarded Bernie loyalty in kind 4 yrs. 2016 is an outlier.
@NicoleJeanLTL @PattiFink @GomezReporting I totally get that. I am an Indy who leans pretty far left.
@NicoleJeanLTL @PattiFink @GomezReporting @SenSanders That is my earnest hope as well. His dedicated caucusing EARNED him that. And you.
