It isn't wealth tht makes poorer people not support a candidate.It's condescension.Hillary hasn't &amp; Sanders has.#PoorDontVote #DropOutBernie
At this point I hope Hillary completely ignores Sanders &amp; focuses on Trump. I hope leading Dems do the same.  #DropOutBernie
Sanders yelling abt speaking fees isn't going to help in general.Trump gets 1.5M a speech &amp; his supporters don't give a rip. #DropOutBernie
