March 25th Tanya @Tanya_Stephens  in Omaha . Do Not Miss.https://t.co/NiqKdYHTki @OmahaNghtOutGde @OmahaToday @Reggae
@CNNPolitics - Because this woman truly did not remember who President Obama is?So shameful.
"@CNNPolitics . Did your report just say ""Hilary Clinton ran all the way against that guy? what do you call him?""- for real-4:25 am central"
"#SuperTuesday - Go &amp; vote knowing that you will be proud of who you are voting for as he/she might the President- No racists, No Clowns"
Voters- please vote wisely and for what you believe in 😊😊😊😊@SuperTuesday
@realDonaldTrump and what did you accomplish for them ? Only Racist Americans support you coz you are their voice to bring back racism
@realDonaldTrump better he bought with lobbyist money that you claim to find your campaign and then you write it off taxes-screwing America
"@BillyT_202 - maybe Trump suffers from affluenza😀😀😀😀😀-that is why he acts like a spoiled brat, and bullies people coz he does not know lol"
"@marcorubio , @SenTedCruz-Ask Trump who will be running his Empire if he was President? Funding his race we know he will write it off taxes"
@BillyT_202 @BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton ask Trump at your next Rally- who will run his Empire if he was President?
@BillyT_202 @BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump-so he is not funding himself- he is just screwing over IRS &amp; will make USA better- how again?
@BillyT_202 @BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton  ~trump funds his race- of course coz he will write it off his taxes as loss
@BillyT_202 @BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton - @backontrack thinks Trump will get is his pocket to give America money- not
@BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump hustling does not equate good presidency . Trump is a hustler
@BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump- who got screwed when he filed for bankruptcy ? Btw was his wife legal when they met? Just wondering too
@BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump I grew up with successful business people who are not shady like Trump-
@BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump - many think same as you - did he file bankruptcy ? How many times? And he is a good businessman - please
@BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump businessmen- not President material. Did you hear why he has illegal workers in Palm Beach- coz it hot-lame
@BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump no normal person will vote for trump and I have a name for all those who do ~ tunnel vision need education
@BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump -with Trump you see the light at the end of the tunnel - but you will get a rude awakening- will revisit
@BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton - yes all lives matter - unfortunately America you promote is to wipe out black people
@BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump - Birds of a feather flock together and sorry to break the news- Trump will never be PResident.
@BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton no one wants to live in Palm Beach coz it is hot? What is the population of Palm Beach ?
"@BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton - tell me exactly what Trump
Will do for America - he hires illegals and claim coz its hot"
@BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton - I am independent and will vote for Clinton or Rubio not Trump
@BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton- am not a Racist- but you are . You support a racist coz he can  openly be your voice
@BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Birds of a feather flock together - many are happy coz he can voice his racism for you all
@BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton he has no respect for women and bullies people- If bullying is a way to WH - good luck
@BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton make stuff up like what- only a racist can not see that trump is a racist- coz it is normal
@BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton - but you rather vote for a racist so he  brings back slavery and segregation- racist trump
@BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton . He had an affair and how many men cheat on their wives? Please give me a break
@BackOnTrackUSA @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton ok  guess what Trump need to release his psych records - you will see he is psycho😀😀😀😀
@realDonaldTrump  no way- as a matter of fact you will not make America safe coz bullying is not good on international Policy
@realDonaldTrump of coz - Alabama is also full of racists that is why they came to support you . No way - bring back slavery = Donald Trump
@FoxNews @tdbmd @megynkelly Fox News is so Pro Republican &amp; so one sided that it is sickening. If I could just cancel that channel on cable
