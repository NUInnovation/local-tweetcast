Can't believe @MSNBC is still treating BS as if he could win nomination. He &amp; his surrogates are STILL getting more airtime than HRC!!

BS's behind 3mil in popular votes..321 pledged delegates &amp; 481 superdelegates..that's NOT gonna change dramatically! #BernieDropOut
"BS should be embarrassed to say he ""won"" IN last night. He spent an est. $1.8mil in state to virtually NOTHING for HRC &amp; only wins by 5%!"
