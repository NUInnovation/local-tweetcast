@mg_callum Welcome to Twitter my handsome son. Mummy is so proud
@SamsungAU Officially worse than Apple as far as support goes. Rang about a faulty battery and was given the run around. Wasted my credit
@sashawillliams Because Jack would have tried to fix the positions and Kate would have tried to manipulate and hog the boys.
@9NewsSyd Look what they are invading now @leesh_jung
@9NewsSyd Can't you gays leave something sacred? Why can't Elsa just be a Disney character attached to no one. Let kids be kids.
@enews Miley Cyrus could possibly be the virus that wipes out humanity @leesh_jung
@trishayearwood @melgin17 Congrats it is always fun to meet interesting cool people.
@calebcgibbs @chelseaomoore If I had the money I would make movies and cast Elizabeth Mitchell and Josh a Holloway plus Chris M and Mariska
@SamsungMobile Samsung you are frauds I had a Samsung note 4 and the battery was a dud. It went flat almost immediately.
@KryptionianBabe Stick Kate. Sawyer and Juliet were the best couple @leesh_jung
@8SmallTownGirl8 I have always shipped Benson and Stabler. I hope he comes back so they can finally get it on lol
@leesh_jung @30secBrawls @hateredpics Self explanatory

#RIPPrince Whoops Another one bites the dust. Something fishy here @leesh_jung
@CrimMinds_CBS FINALLY CM Hired A Brilliant Actor. The awesome Frances Fisher @leesh_jung
@MattTaven The wrestling World is ruthless it seems.
#RIPChyna Sad as she seemed to be a nice person whose life just spun out of control. Hope she is in a better place now @leesh_jung
@KFCAustralia Hey I have a friend who loves KFC so much that he drives 2hrs just to get it. Don't you think he deserves a treat of you lot?
@LaurenDewey Clue who they are lol.
@LaurenDewey True I love her acting but I doubt I would recognise her. Famous people are in and out where I work all the time . I have no
@mstrinket @csi_spy Yes I would love to see how Sawyer and Juliet fell in love
@LizMitchellFC About Josh Holloway lol
@leesh_jung @_gistering @BBCNews Screeech
@leesh_jung @JakkDaws the rat dogs can get out as well
@LaurenDewey Well she may be a very good actor but still just a person
@joezimmerman @JoshButler Filthy pair of over paid druggos think they are above the law. Oh Isis take these two @leesh_jung
@JakkDaws These two drugged out morons can stay the fuck out of Australia. God knows what diseases they could bring in @leesh_jung
@_gistering @BBCNews ACDC are done. Why put this creepy screeching nutcase in? @leesh_jung

@leesh_jung Crack snap pop
@leesh_jung you probably caused them
@leesh_jung A lot of earthquakes lately. Have you been to jump in?
@dailytelegraph Keep the evil thing locked up. The followers of that evil thing had the same blood lust in them as he had. No pity
@leesh_jung @MichaelEmerson Yep She is brilliant as well. I can't watch mediocre now
@leesh_jung @MichaelEmerson I know Lost had some quality actors that upped the bar for me
@MichaelEmerson Welcome to Twitter Mr Emerson @leesh_jung This is one of the sublime actors who has made it impossible for me to watch crap
@LucFrank1 @juliebenz @DaneCook @BarbaraHershey8 You are in for a treat. Awesome movie

@JaxsieJackal @leesh_jung Yes she is very precious. Very smart too
@CocaColaAU I brought a bottle of coke and it was flat. Disappointing from such a big company. Can't you sell a decent product??
@MacLeodAndrews @leesh_jung Sorry to bother you but I was just wondering if you are going to be in any movies in the future?
#NationalPetDay The most precious thing in the world is a pet agree @leesh_jung https://t.co/0eNMtcGe7S
"@JaneCaro @AustralianStory John Howard was a one of our best Prime Ministers. A true, brave leader  ."
Here’s the Most Useful Personality Quiz You’ll Ever Take https://t.co/jZpUPsjcLQ via mydailyquizz @leesh_jung
@sundaynighton7 Michelle Payne is a decent young lady all the best to her. Rachael Griffith though is pretentious. Saw $$$ there hey
@maccas I brought breakfast at Maccas this morning and it was disgusting. The bun was burnt and the egg was like rubber the juice tasted yuk
@EvanDumouchel Just watched The Movie They Look Like People. You were great in it. Good to look at as well
@MacLeodAndrews Hey Cutie I just watched They Look like People and your acting was spot on. Great job

@4PsychicLOVE Guess my thoughts if you do you get a lolly psychic @leesh_jung
@opinion8dBitch @leesh_jung but do not expect others to do as you do.
@opinion8dBitch @leesh_jung None of you are God. You have no right to pass judgement on anyone or anything.  You live a miserable life
@opinion8dBitch @leesh_jung Again you narrow minded fool neither of them admitted to a single thing. You Christians are fanatical
@opinion8dBitch @leesh_jung Neither admitted anything you idiot. Get your facts straight before you start preaching
@MollyQuinn93 @maddiealex7 @NathanFillion happy birthday cutie
@leesh_jung @NRL_Dragons That's why they are the softest team in the NRL.!
@spodermenpls @HoppyRog That's about right for boring Spider-Man
@NRL_Dragons Hey Dragons can you tell Mitch Rein that he looks like a Dragon Queen with that pretty hair @leesh_jung
@melgin17 @8soup @trishayearwood Disgusting behaviour.
@melgin17 @8soup @trishayearwood Seriously some women need to draw a line and respect that once a man is married then he is off limits
@SingStarHQ Please stop with the foreign language stuff and put some more ABBA and 70's and 80's stuff in the store
@leesh_jung Uncanny resemblance? https://t.co/h8TABh7FAr

@emmanolans Yeah I hope so. Should get someone to tell the writers how good Josh Holloway and Elizabeth Mitchell look good together
@emmanolans Cool she seems like a lovely lady. Wish Josh Holloway was in the show.

@ThePassionLive Wow breathtaking awesome performance by Trisha Yearwood
