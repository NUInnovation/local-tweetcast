@9NEWS that's why there are no good stores on 16th mall. I took my parents from out of town. Scraggy.
@CBSNews @JohnKasich @realDonaldTrump I don't know. You were pretty mean about the elderly benefits.
@MattStephens  great stuff!
@Avschamp @MikeKlis good word tumultuous.
@Millerlite40 @ACMawards way to rep.
@CSURamT boo.

@coloradoan I love this man Sonny Lubick. He brought CSU up. We need to analyze his strengths and vision to see if we can be up again.
