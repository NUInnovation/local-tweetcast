@TMZ @Bossip so fake
@realDonaldTrump you can't even get support from the leader of ur own party chump!
@CNNPolitics @danmericaCNN if u want to hurt Trump you need media to not write bout Trump at all. Don't feed fuel to his fire
"@FoxNews @ericbolling been out 7 years w/o incident. Prison needs to suck, it's the only way ppl won't want to go back. Call it how it is"
@FoxNews @ericbolling I'm an ex felon/convict. Why not? That's what we are. I knowingly broke the law for personal gain. Can't sugarcoat it
@ESPNNBA so disrespectful...they have nowhere near the knowledge on the issue to discuss that topic. C'mon man!!!
@Espngreeny I'm with Golic https://t.co/66wgL3NGk7
@espn maybe he didn't see you bud?!?!
@TMZ big cuz was a bystander not pulled from melee; such bs tmz
@RealSkipBayless but they need to feed JV way more if guards continue to struggle
"@RealSkipBayless both teams have played horrible in this series, and would be easy pickings for Cavs"
@BleacherReport they report when family members get speeding tickets now too...or is it cause the media hates Boogie!!!
@BillSimmons he's a 3 dwarf
@JJWatt and they stiffed Sweetness in that game. God damn shame. One of the best players/person ever
@JJWatt Buddy Ryan &gt; Mike Ditka
@ESPNSteinLine @TheJetOnTNT might as well ask TMac too
@ESPNSteinLine @TheJetOnTNT what a mistake that would be for the Rockets and the jet
@CNNPolitics @jaketapper this is y every trump supporter is afraid to admit they support him when they're not around other trump supporters
@mcuban where's the three feet Cuban?
@RealSkipBayless where was the 3 feet
@MagicJohnson what bout the 3 feet he's supposed to give???
@ODoyle_Rules25 @ESPNSteinLine that's the rate; and it's the Lakers. Let's be honest. He's getting top dollar!
@ODoyle_Rules25 @ESPNSteinLine I'd go from Goldman Sachs to McDonald's if they were going to pay me over 5 mill a year
@dallascowboys Lynch is overrated and trading up for a unproven backup is a mistake. Drafting Smith is risky but their doc did surgery
@thejaylonsmith 51 like the great Ken Norton Jr. He was versatile beyond his years...can't wait to see you in the blue and white!!!
@MagicJohnson ya my Kings should call him too huh magic lol
@MagicJohnson hahaha
"@MagicJohnson getting ahead of urself, Heat still have to beat raptors/Pacers"
@MagicJohnson no they dont
"@ODoyle_Rules25 @ESPNSteinLine it's a job to coach his old team, and maybe the most popular franchise in sports. And again waaaaay more $$$"
@ODoyle_Rules25 @ESPNSteinLine no one is going to remember an assistant coach. And Luke might be able to start something special in LA
@ODoyle_Rules25 @ESPNSteinLine he will make prob five times as much and it's a win-win situation
@ODoyle_Rules25 @ESPNSteinLine greatness is good but money is better...he will never be in such high demand again as a head coach
@terrellowens @warriors @spurs @espn @JalenRose NBA sucks now fans don't want blowouts in 2nd rd of playoffs.
@ODoyle_Rules25 @ESPNSteinLine Buss expects Playoffs next year. And they have no leadership. Plus a horrible roster
@ODoyle_Rules25 @ESPNSteinLine obviously he's going to fail. He took advantage of his likeness for a huge payday. Who can blame him?
@FoxNews when really 98 in 100 actually do it
@VICE COD2 was the dawn of an era...don't ever disrespect 360. I wasted so much of my life playing that game
@nytimes must be nice...I wonder if they bet it all on black or red???
@ODoyle_Rules25 @ESPNSteinLine the roster is stacked...today's NBA is player driven. Coaches need talent. Kerr hit coaching lottery in GSW
@ODoyle_Rules25 @ESPNSteinLine so Kerr had more losses this season than Luke. Explain??
@RealSkipBayless someone please tell pop to start giving interviews. He makes 2016 money act like a 2016 coach
@RealSkipBayless really
@BillSimmons Luke Walton is not the next Pop and that is what the Lakers need. Not sum1 who got lucky to interim the best reg season team
@ODoyle_Rules25 @ESPNSteinLine Kerr hit the lottery that Jackson and Jerry West set up for him. Just lucky mgmt didn't like jackson
"@ESPNSteinLine let's be honest, this one is bout the $$$$ 🤑"
@SacramentoKings 😎
@dallascowboys @EzekielElliott better live up to the hype...we can't afford to miss on a #4 overall pick
@Espngreeny he's got some accuracy issues tho too
@espngolic @thejaylonsmith maybe top 2 players of this class 😎
@SportsCenter can't wait
"@RealSkipBayless skip has his faults, but if he knew nothing he wouldn't have 1.8M followers and make $5M a year"
@pmarti9 @RealSkipBayless he def is tho bud
"@BillSimmons shut up Simmons. He shattered his phone, he obviously did something. Move on with ur miserable life"
"@ESPNSteinLine I'd be pissed if Van Gundy coached my team, he was an avg coach who hasn't seen a sideline in a generation"
@HillaryClinton @jimmyfallon TRUMP= 65% unfavorable...why would he intimidate anyone?!?! Gonna be a landslide for H
@ESPNNBA superstars win games but they need some help around them. Harden off the rockets = 2016 Lakers
@ESPNNBA saying Harden is the problem is like saying cousins is the problem on Sac!
@ESPNNBA gotta feel for Harden and show why maybe he is a premadonna.
@stephenasmith gotta take SAS's side on this...u signed the contract so own up to it. Take it up with players association in off season
@BillSimmons @ringer go get fired from another network imp...or be a Tyrion Lannister double haha
"@BillSimmons @ringer nat'l media= hate on every team besides CLE, SA, OKC, GSW, and maybe LAC...Go STFU Simmons"
"@FactsInYourFace guys are Alpha Males, u hang a steak in front of my face I'll tell u I'm hungry. Post risqué pics we will want to bang u"
@FactsInYourFace be mad that ur hot and guys want to hook up with u. u post pics barely covered up?!?! Really? I don't get it
"@BillSimmons someone needs to inform these glorified writers that there's less than a 1,000 NBA roster spots."
"@BillSimmons love how national media mock deep bench guys in pro sports. These ""scrubs"" are ballers and work there ass off to get there"
@BernieSanders @drvox @CNN Bernie is the one who refuses to elaborate on his policies and limits himself
"@Daz555 @stephenasmith @StephenCurry30 Harden is still a top 10 player, show respect"
"@Daz555 @stephenasmith @StephenCurry30 maybe, but Houston took one with Curry there so it's not a given."
@stephenasmith @StephenCurry30 hate how national media only respect maybe five teams in the league...so disrespectful!!!
@stephenasmith @StephenCurry30 they still gotta beat houston
@David_Gergen @OutFrontCNN @ErinBurnett @CNN no path to victory. He must drop out. Back Hillary and do what's best for the party
@MagicJohnson thanks for giving GSW props and not hating on Houston.
@terrellowens @CharlesBarkIey @NBAonTNT @SHAQ @TheJetOnTNT @Bracinskywalker T.O. We got the same TV haha
@CalMensBBall @YoungIvee worked with dudes dad; and he said he was gonna play at least 2 yrs. can't say I believed him at the time. Go Bears
@RealSkipBayless Cavs don't make playoffs w/o Lebron even with KLove
@RealSkipBayless loves Tebow but hates on Lebron lol
@RealSkipBayless haters gonna hate
@Espngreeny 21 3's Greeny and u think someone could've beat them. I think not. Houston could've played better but give GSW some credit
@Espngreeny they knocked down 21 3's...no one was beating them tonight. Steph or no steph
"@Espngreeny I usually agree with Greeny but Harden went off 18,7,10, w/7 steals...if Draymond had this line everybody would applaud him"
@FactsInYourFace so are they really actors then???
@torgonudho @HillaryClinton @GMA not true
@bantzMAGA @HillaryClinton @GMA every president or meaningful politician contributes to murder at some point
@TheDougChristie @ReggieMillerTNT ya not an off foul especially in that situation. They should've doubled
@RussilloKanell @dannykanell you suck at football and at talk radio. Stop talking bout ur self. M&amp;M to R&amp;k is like going from GSW to 76ers
@BillSimmons cuz he wants full control of roster...that's why nobody should hire him
@ESPNNBA records are meant to be broken...who cares! Kobe dropped 60 on a farewell game at 37. And hit another game winner
@RussilloKanell the Kings are in turmoil and cuz has problems but if he was on a winning team he'd be called the best big of a generation
@RussilloKanell all kings fans are dumb but ur so smart cuz u asked Stephen A about this for five minutes and now ur a genius
"@RussilloKanell @ryenarussillo just curious who these guys are, some scrubs who took over SVP and MT's slot..."
@ESPNNBA too bad no one watched it cuz Kobe went crazy!!!
@Isaiah_Thomas Pizza Guy!!! Ball out on all the haters!
@Isaiah_Thomas Kings fans pullin for u in the playoffs; mgmt here can't evaluate talent worth shit! Ball out!
@ggerould great final sign off for the season and an era in Sac. Proud to have the best play by play basketball voice in the Association 🙏👏💯
"Dallas Votes to Zone 30-year-old Garage Out of Biz. To Make Way for “Starbucks and Macaroni Grill"" https://t.co/eaeUElboWk via @Change"
@SportsCenter they're really hurting for money that bad?!?! This is absurd
@MikeAndMike but some guys/teams are win only because huge fails...2014 Patriots!!!
@PGATOUR I bet Rory woke up feeling better today😜
@Espngreeny is awesome for the Mike H-Lad convo right now...has me weak
@ggerould GMan is going to be calling games next season right? I remember listening to games with my dad as young as 6 in our living room
@ESPNSteinLine gotta give credit tho ur only as good as it record says u are
"@ESPNSteinLine good stat, I can think of 3-4 games they should've lost but teams collapsed and warriors made shots"
@ESPNSteinLine they better clean up their game before seeing Clips in second round
"@BrandtSnedeker been pulling for Sneds for years, would love to see him finish in top five; since Rory fell out I see Speith locking it up"
@BernieSanders just give up the war on drugs and do what? Legalize Heroin and coke?!?! Wtf is this senile old man thinking
@Casspi18 we will be rooting you on next season lighting it up from downtown in Golden One Center
@Espngreeny most games they've looked average in the last month. I got a feeling they get knocked off in second round
@NBA @warriors @memgrizz looking pretty ugly going into post season I got a good feeling they don't make it to the WCF
@TheDougChristie disappointing I spent much of these team years partying and missing too many games
"@RussilloKanell these guys suck, Mike and Mike, and PTI guys are really saving ESPN right now 👊"
@Espngreeny so I'd go with close game cuz I'm a cowboys fan and I hate being smacked talked to me after a blowout
@Espngreeny w/a blowout ur channel surfing by the 4th but u here it all week at work; w/a nail biter I think about what if's for years...
@QuincyAcy pretty damn good
"@TheDougChristie yup gotta give credit tho if that's how Jay drew it up, and hell of a clutch shot"
@ryenarussillo @RussilloKanell douche bag
@TheDougChristie made me think of C Late 92-93 Duke. Gotta put pressure on the ball
@TMZ @TooFab horrible finale
@CBSNews @realDonaldTrump @JohnKasich anybody who would vote for Kasich def would not vote for Trump...so Kasich in prob helps Trump
@ESPNNBA in 5 only advantage warriors would have is Steph...and he played horribly in the last years finals. MJ and crew would dominate
@ESPNNBA sad the Kings can get more out of a player than the Mavs....says something
"@sactownroyalty he's not leaving that much money on the table, just cause of his prise"
@realDonaldTrump @DebraRakestraw @HillaryClinton but Justin Bieber has 75 mill followers...should he be our next pres. Repubs knowledge haha
"@SacramentoKings @OldenPolynice1 @SleepTrainArena O-P that's old school right there...with BGrant, Corliss, the rock, Lionel, and many more"
"""Who Should Tank the Rest of the Season?"" via @TeamStream https://t.co/9ZxpWdPQEC"
@FoxNews easier said than done bud
@Cowbell_Kingdom @ryananderson33 Anderson  the only big that fits with Cuz. Any other big would be nice but money is better spent elsewhere
@Cowbell_Kingdom but on the guard side I would let Rondo walk if we could somehow pry Mike Conley from the Grizz
@Cowbell_Kingdom the only one I think the Kings should pursue that should fit our style of play should be Ryan Anderson
@gene423 @VanJones68 that might be true but is that how we want to judge ppl? On out of context sound bytes?!?!
@VanJones68 @TimBartender I know Van has been big on Bernie and that's cool he didn't just jump on Bill for that and was objective 🙏👏
@realDonaldTrump funny how all trump supporters are all white males; good luck vs Hillary in Nov hahaha 😜😜😜
@realDonaldTrump should he come home and anger the whole Islamic community with negative rhetoric like a Trump president would?!?!
@SSvendsen19 @Cowbell_Kingdom def agree. Just like the past cpl seasons I only hope we can hit a home run in the draft and figure it out
@SSvendsen19 @Cowbell_Kingdom but I'm not mad about the WCS pick...but I still don't think they've developed him very well over the year
@SSvendsen19 @Cowbell_Kingdom you can only hope management has it figured out now even tho either Karl or Cousins will be leaving
@SSvendsen19 @Cowbell_Kingdom Kings have proven to fail at picking the right guy in the draft and have really never developed guard talent
"@Cowbell_Kingdom and there is plenty of combo guard talent to go around Dunn, brown, Murray, Hield, etc"
@Cowbell_Kingdom good on staying realistic...but I think the best bet is to address this need in the draft. Kings get top 10 pick
"@nytimes interesting article, but I still feel he should've gained more traction than he has"
@CNNPolitics hindsight is 20/20
@Chris_Broussard he's had some games for sure. Good call Broussard giving love to non top-tier players...I like it
@AC360 @CNN what a douche bag
@WojVerticalNBA good article...even tho players and owners will never see eye to eye; I think Jordan will bring good perspective
@TMZ @gossipgirl heartless!!!
"@RealSkipBayless b/c you played doesn't mean you should deny the pros who have written, commentated, analyzed the game their entire lives"
"@RealSkipBayless and you shouldn't have to be a previous player to analyze, commentate, or critique the game. I hate that trend."
@RealSkipBayless I don't think any player would ever question Mike Tomlin...prob top 5 coach in the last 10 years
@AlexNaylor01 @ESPNNBA check stats son. Boogie is a better scorer and rebounder. AD maybe better on D
@Tamez0517 @_angel218_ @MagicJohnson out in Cali we actually have lives #SacramentoProud
@Tamez0517 @_angel218_ @MagicJohnson damn I knew SA was lame but fuck u guys stayed on here for two hours talking to each other lol
@AlexNaylor01 @ESPNNBA outside of Rudy and Rondo our team is weak
"@AlexNaylor01 @ESPNNBA Jrue Holiday, Ryan Anderson, Reke, Eric Gordon plus others is more talent than the kings"
@Tamez0517 @_angel218_ @MagicJohnson at least Kobe knows what time it is...deuces to the lames from SA gonna be nice watching Steph ball onu
@_angel218_ @Tamez0517 @MagicJohnson 8 and 7 for the best of ever lol time to hang it up
"@Tamez0517 @_angel218_ @MagicJohnson wow cause ur city has a good team, ur lame ass think ur somebody"
@jazavala54 @_angel218_ @MagicJohnson huh
@jazavala54 @_angel218_ @MagicJohnson no doubting that. The kings are the anti Spurs for sure
@jazavala54 @_angel218_ @MagicJohnson nobody is scared of Duncan and his Jester tattoo lolol
@jazavala54 @_angel218_ @MagicJohnson he should thank the Spurs every day for getting him off the pacers
@jazavala54 @_angel218_ @MagicJohnson Kawhi went a solid 5-16 from the field damn he's top 3 talent lol product of pop
@jazavala54 @_angel218_ @MagicJohnson he played over 30 min lame
@CrucifyyJ @_angel218_ @MagicJohnson they are trash but I still watch every game and will rep them but they do suck
@_angel218_ @jazavala54 @MagicJohnson you flew to Sac lol
@_angel218_ @jazavala54 @MagicJohnson u guys won smart guy
@jazavala54 @_angel218_ @MagicJohnson that's part of a solid 2-11 outing for Aldridge lol great max player u got there. Cuz owns him
@_angel218_ @CrucifyyJ @MagicJohnson Kings where Boogie who is relevant and just dropped a 20/20 game tonight 👊🙏👊😎
@jazavala54 @_angel218_ @MagicJohnson Duncan didn't even score in like 20 min lol and Aldridge had 7 points lmao
@jazavala54 @_angel218_ @MagicJohnson Kings franchise is garbage but Boogie took it to both Duncan and Aldridge last time they played
@CrucifyyJ @_angel218_ @MagicJohnson best thing Duncan has done this year is the commercial with DRose
@CrucifyyJ @_angel218_ @MagicJohnson what watch his 8 min lol go 😂 bout ur washed up Duncan
@_angel218_ @CrucifyyJ @MagicJohnson 8 points 7 boards he's a real difference maker lol
"@CrucifyyJ @_angel218_ @MagicJohnson watching Duncan play, is like watching Kobe play if he still played four years from now lol Garbage"
@_angel218_ @MagicJohnson they're just part of ur depth...patty mills is better than Parker noe
"@_angel218_ @MagicJohnson Parker, ginnobili, and Duncan are irrelevant. None are even in the top 100 players in the league...IRRELEVANT"
"@_angel218_ @MagicJohnson idk bud. My point is they aren't relevant and if they win this year it will be because of Kawhi, Aldridge, &amp; depth"
@_angel218_ @MagicJohnson the Spurs have depth so the big 3 thing doesn't really work. None of those guys really need to be game planned for
@_angel218_ @MagicJohnson and obviously it was his plan my point exactly Diaw gave them a better chance to win than Duncan
@_angel218_ @MagicJohnson and in no way did that tweet have anything to do with pop
