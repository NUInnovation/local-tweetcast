Book and Music Festival at Honolulu Hale this weekend. Don't miss!
"Ahh, come on Susan. Get with the program! https://t.co/YWFlcLGFB3"
Let's work together to reinstate creditation of Honolulu's zoo.
Ala Moana's Park is ready for upgrading!
"Try Honolulu's Formaggio's great for drinks, pupus and conversation"
Hardest on Nepali side. Can nearly drive to it on the Tibetan side?! https://t.co/XZOOEfMLEo
Harris UMC will take an offering Sunday for Fiji and Ecuador!
Go Hillary! The country and the world needs you.
Average daily steps per week went from 8500 to 11600 last week with the visit of grand niece. Living with an 11 year old is good for health.
"Great visit from my grand niece but needed today to recoup from Diamond Head, Makapuu, downtown walks and Arizona, Missouri and Bishop!"
"Momentum, that is."
Let's keep the moment for Hiliary going and start joining ranks. Need to retain the best of our values!
Diamond Head and malasadas before church tomorrow!!!!
Busy days with grand niece but rested during enjoyable new Jungle Book movie.
Good for the people of Sanagaon https://t.co/HISPilKV0e
Embarrassing for the PM?? for being so retro? https://t.co/6RTJc3WH8c
Hawaiian Airlines HNL check in looks like a third world check in. Chaos!! Thankfully a safe flying record so perhaps worth it.
Terrible! Couldn't have been easily removed. https://t.co/xvxGbCIp4b
Pencil trees! The bane of E. Honolulu gardeners.
"Windy, cloudy cool day in Honolulu. Love it!"
Looking forward to 11 year old grand niece's visit next week!
"Book&amp;Music Festival, Honolulu the end of April! https://t.co/lLqEH6rmnL"
Sad. https://t.co/Sqv9XOqVac
I give up. What is OSMO? https://t.co/oUtBpOShFp
"Good luck, Sidiq https://t.co/1CFzGkjA6f"
Yes and countries should have their own autonomous churches.  https://t.co/AvTKSf6i0b
So Neanderthal! https://t.co/A4b7H84P0S

But is it chocolate? https://t.co/nJ53SDzwHS
Slowed down by the Indian border obstruction. https://t.co/bdehBnOkVN
This has been the case for years. Unfair to the children and their families. https://t.co/6ubx7gzmS4

Thankfully. https://t.co/ucGwXjjKXw
Perhaps. https://t.co/J7jwwF0ZjQ
"Hawaii's Democratic primary is  low key. After registering and indicating preference on nicely printed ballots, they are put in paper bags!"
Aina Hina's  Democratic primary site was busy. Bernie signs all over with one or two for Hiliary. My vote for Hiliary in paper bag!!
Essential reading for all well intentioned people!!  https://t.co/YOaNPRFsMq
Justice moves slowly. https://t.co/F0I3WzB0Yu
Look to the church in India for historical experience with this approach  https://t.co/n2cL4575rd
Can't hurt! Or shouldn't! https://t.co/bnRKINWyDn
Today is the day that Hawaiian Democrats indicate that presidential candidate preference. A vote for Hiliary will ensure the general!!
A shot not tried is a shot missed. A quote from some basketball guru.
"Jen, think again. Don't condemn our country to Cruz or Trump. Become an independent and vote for Hiliary."
Little sisters need to think of others not themselves!
Trump and Cruz get scarier as the campaign continues. As Alter indicted. Are we becoming a banana republic?
"And prevent dengue, encephalitis , Zika, malaria and more. https://t.co/YBXCOq0a2e"

Yesterday was PI day; 3.14 etc.
Schooled???? https://t.co/j5cinqD1OP
Absolutely! https://t.co/jUAqdMhd69
18 fouls and 19 points so far in the first half.
"The Wahine's game much better than this one; fouls and flops; rough and unpleasant, https://t.co/sbNcrB9k98"
8 minutes into Big West championship and 9 fouls. Boring!
Trump reading poetry re the snake. How weird can it get?
Great game! https://t.co/svmzQ8918F
Perhaps I'm greedy but I would like the Wahine keeping the 20 point lead!
One of the early states to support women's high school basketball! https://t.co/ZWnyNvGfvG
