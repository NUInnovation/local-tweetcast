"I want to go back in time to the 50s,60s &amp;70s when men still had respect for women,understood how to treat women&amp;women respected themselves."
"Talk out our problems, differences, allowed ppl not to always feel judged, but shown equal kindness &amp; love bc we can &amp; God made us to do so."
As United States of America citizens let's stick together &amp; show everyone how POWERFUL WE CAN BE if we focus on the things WE HAVE IN COMMON
Doesn't that send an amazing message that anybody can be anything if they try their best at what they're passionate about? #EQUALITYFORALL
Now if WE do that &amp; stick together as a NATION + change can only happen. Think about ur kids&amp; theirs 👀 a BLACK male followed by white WOMAN.
"That WE didn't base it on their skin color, race, religion, or sex. But because they honor what the USA stands for &amp; wants to accomplish."
Wouldn't it be amazing for our kids &amp; their kids to know now &amp; in the future we as a nation elected the most qualified Presidents???
Think of USA not yourselves as a very rich or very poor person. If we give lots more power or money to one side or the other it's unbalanced
Hillary Clinton is the MOST ACCEPTING&amp; amazing woman with incredible political insight&amp; knowledge. ONLY REAL CHOICE. https://t.co/duXnQ7KRjL
Past hurt from love can't effect the love u can&amp;r willing to show others now bc it's new love with a new purpose&amp;u have an unlimited supply.
Because no matter if they return it or don't appreciate it at all... Guess what? You have an unlimited amount of love to show to whoever😊👌🏼
Learned something awhile ago &amp; didn't really understand it until lately... It doesn't matter what people do with the love you show them.
Oh that's why... https://t.co/JSoV6WmG7m
Why can't people just put out love and get shown love? Why are we living in a world where you either use or be used?
Sooo tired of being used when all I give out is love... DONE WITH IT.🙄
"Believe in yourself &amp; love yourself then you won't feel sad, mad, awkward, weird, or whatever you may feel when doing ANYTHING ALONE🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼😘😘"
"Guess what you can do anything by yourself👍🏼 go to a movie, to eat, exercise in gym/or outside, drive around, literally ANYTHING. YOU CAN🙌🏼"
AMERICANS don't allow Donald Trump to use our generation as his experiment of crazy horrible change that will dig us to far down to come up.
@HillaryClinton is the ONLY choice anybody should see fit to make a revolution possible for immense +change for AMERICA &amp; it's core values.
"Hillary PLEASE SAVE THE U.S., MY MONEY, MY GENERATION, AND ALLOW OUR CHILDREN &amp; THEIR CHILDREN TO THRIVE!!! #onlyhillarycansaveusnow #simple"
Unemployment for able people is STUPID!!!We are encouraging people to not go back to work by paying them more for doing nothing!!!#putinwork
"But if someone is able to work and there is always a job available may not be the dream job, but they're jobs. THEN THEY SHOULD WORK!!!"
If people are mental or physically disabled to the point they cannot work okay I will gladly allow money to be taken from my check.
"You may think I'm being extremely harsh and mean even, but to do all of those things it takes money from you... The more of it👆🏼more money👆🏼"
"And NOT give more money, resources, and easy access to foreign people wanting to become U.S. Citizens."
Why I love Hillary Clinton &amp; why she is going to save the people who work there butts of for their family... https://t.co/aO5MD8gGWu
How I feel🙌🏼🙏🏼☺️ The world would be an even more amazing place. https://t.co/Iknuh15tpp
"Find yourself, learn to love yourself &amp; then BE YOU. Everything else will fall in place and work it's way out with Gods help."
Y'all keep having babies I'll gladly babysit and give them back😂 I REALLY DO LOVE BABIES THOUGH!!😍👶🏻👶🏼👶🏽👶🏾👶🏿👶#teamnobabiesformetillmarriage
Think people because you only get one life on earth make it the best possible one to make you the BEST &amp; HAPPIEST YOU.
"Etc. then how would you ever be able to choose the right people, decisions, and ultimately live the life you truly want to-be the BEST YOU??"
"If you don't know yourself every single thought, reasoning for the thought, wants, needs, beliefs, morals, dreams, fantasies, passions,goals"
And if so... Are you truly happy with yourself and where you are in life &amp; this moment? Fine yourself or everything around will be wrong...
"Ladies and Gents if you hate being alone for more than an hour or even 2,3 hours...? You might wanna rethink if you truly know yourself?"
"Oh that's right it's 2016 people are 60% superficial, 25% selfish, and 15% real and show their true soul and self... I was born to late..."
Why can't people just care about people for no superficial reasons just because they're a good person and have a beautiful soul???
Love this😍🙌🏼 the one on the left specifically😜 https://t.co/yqP4M3f7TR
Why I'll always be a Hippie at HEART😊✌🏼over all!!! https://t.co/JMMBC6xdIF

It's hard to fit things in 140 characters...🙄
"If you build up yourself by helping you&amp;others&amp;showing kindness to all you will be a much better person, stronger&amp;have good base to fall on."
"Selfishness,only taking care of you &amp;ur needs/wants will raise you up for a short time,but wait&amp;see how far you fall with no one to fall on."
Blows my mind to think about how some people literally HATE to care for/help others... You can lift yourself up a lot higher by being kind😊
You NEED to love yourself and understand yourself before trying to to do that for someone else... BE YOU &amp; PROUD!!!
If you aren't happy alone for a long period of time... Don't get in a relationship... Promise it won't work either at the start-deep into it
Two feelings toward people right now  either I want to hug the heck out of you or punch you in the face. MOOD😂😂😂 Stupid ppl make me mad. 🙇🏼
If the only reason you talk to me or are friends with me is for your own advantage to use me for whatever it maybe... ✌🏼️I don't need you.
I'm in microbiology and my nutrition teacher makes nutrition harder like whatttt?!? #Ihateonlineclasses
When people call me momma Hannah or remind them of their mom I laugh😂😂😂 Just like to take care of other people...However I see they need it😊
Over society✌🏼😴
