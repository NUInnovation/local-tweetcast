@CliffBarackman so nice to hear your expressed respect for native peoples. Your example stands in stark contrast to Matt's indifference.

"Lost in all the hubbub about finding a knife on OJ Simpson's former property: another cop not doing his or her job. Funny, huh? Yeah. No."
"Trump being shot down and vilified and shamed isn't working, because like OJ said, he isn't black. I only hope his supporters can be shamed."
The upside of Trump's ascendency? He is a good counter to painfully awkward and bigoted talks about OJ.
Just listened to a white co-worker talk (down) to a black co-worker about the knife found on OJ's former property. Terrible.
