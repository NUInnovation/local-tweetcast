"I say Michigan was a fluke. #HillaryClinton, FTW!"
Kudos to #HillaryClinton for amassing great numbers of delegates at tonight's #SuperTuesday2016 for the democratic presidential nomination.
Heard Ted Cruz making fun of #HillaryClinton in his pseudo victory speech in Missouri and found it lacklustre both in delivery and punch.
Hahaha! https://t.co/oHrmoA6l3O
You're younger than him and way better. https://t.co/vJofV2OIOA
True. Lol! https://t.co/HLtJQUSJ5H
Tonight's #TheWalkingDead was pure epic.
Lightening? https://t.co/TclnjY2Oqu
Still am not getting concrete that Bernie made except you badmouthing Hillary. Good luck on Tuesday. https://t.co/GYWPHGDt26
Hillary was instrumental in rebuilding America's position in the world when she was the Secretary of State. Stellar! https://t.co/0u4lov6b9o
"Stellar? That's too much of an adjective for Bernie. I want something concrete that he has done. Empty, I say. https://t.co/ZoygsEX0Iw"
What about Bernie? I know he is a senator from Vermont but what has he concretely done aside from finger wagging?  https://t.co/BheZlTNdA8
"FYI, #HillaryClinton got these planned out and it will happen in her presidency unlike Bernie's vacuous promises. https://t.co/GbdA5HyAah"
"Really? Bernie has so many promises that are fakes like Gucci bags in Chinatown. Good luck to that. #Hillary, FTW! https://t.co/GTlRemNMf9"
...And yet she's still standing tall and resilient despite. Would rather vote for her than someone like Bernie. https://t.co/jexSqkFnlp
#HillaryClinton is the one who can beat #DonaldTrump. #Bernie is a republican pretending to be democrat and he looks grumpier each day.
"If there's somebody out there who's been vilified, ridiculed, bad-mouthed for 25+years and still standing tall then that's #HillaryClinton."
Scores! Yay #Canucks
#Canucks for the win tonight.
Stoked to watch #Canucks tonight. Please win!
"I'm following this guy on #facebook.He wrote a morbid line and I think he may hurt himself. His name is Joe Mullin,  #George, #SouthAfrica."

Rick and Michonne finally getting sumthin sumthin. #TheWalkingDead
Yep. https://t.co/HX1R7w2Rcd
Would've been a shut out but that's fine. A win is a win. #Canucks
"#Canucks winning for a change but too early to tell, given their history of losing it all in the third period. Please don't."
