@mmurraypolitics How is a national survey between Clinton and Sanders of 339 voters a true sampling of the voting populous? Gimme a break!!
I believe that you and we are friends so it is fine.
@TheEllenShow Thank u 4 your chat about MS's HB 1523.  We were legally married here last fall.  Your support is monumental to us here~❤️
@mitchellreports Hillary did not call Sanders unqualified; he DID call her such more than once!!  How dare you try and conflate the two~😡
"Mississippi Governor, Phil Bryant is not only an idiot but our state's CEO and Chief Bigot!!!  #repeal HB1523~"
@svantonova65617 Thanks 4 the follow👍❤️
WWE's Wrestle Mania 32 is a big fail ~ Vince McMahon &amp; creative are force feeding us Roman Reigns as Champ as we continue to  vomit😫
@MarshallRamsey Thanks for your earlier tweet about HB1523~ #equalityforallinMS
"@HarryConickJR If our Governor in MS signs the latest Religious Freedom Bill, please consider delaying your show here in June. Thanks xo"
@samsteinhp I continue to get frustrated with Joe &amp; Mika &amp; how you dealt with them plus Bob Woodward this am is amazing~Kudos👍
Arrives*
I will gets lots of pleasure once it arruves👍😈
I am not concerned about that
@davidaxelrod @tedcruz Oh David Im no fan of Senator Cruz but this analysis from you is beneath decency.
@davidaxelrod You are incorrect in your assessment of Tarp II and Hillary's use of the auto-bailout link.
Happy Wednesday!!❤️👍
@Caitlyn_Jenner You are an embarrassment to the transgendered community with your political rhetoric.  Ted Cruz would say no to you~ Wake up

Im tiring of the on-air personalities at MSNBC.  What is this a cheap knock-off of Fox (Faux) News?  Matthews &amp; Hayes MUST go~
@hardball_chris Why must you consistently interrupt the guests on your show?  Cut out your anti-Hillary rhetoric as well.
@clairecmc Positive energy; lots of love and many prayers for you and your family~ Wishing you a speedy recovery!!❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏😘😘😘
@maddow I lost some respect for you in your interview with DNC Chair about super delegates. You're damaged goods; sad as I was a huge fan.
"@davidaxelrod Agreed; especially when the last two words of the blurb are ""Read this"""
@JoeNBC You are really a sickening partisan jerk.
Secretary Clinton squeaked out a narrow win in Iowa last night~ Thankfully!!  On to NH where Senator Sanders has a large lead. Hillary 2016~

@LiftNLoad @jasunmark LOL~ She is a disaster on many levels.
@nickcapra smokin' HOT bro ~
@BrittLittLegit  The nepotism reference was about Bray Wyatt who is over because his Dad is Mike Rotunda.
Santino please come back!!
@WWECreative_ish @FightOwensFight Whatever!? Cena put him over...another out of shape fat blob like Bray Wyatt...over by nepotism not skill
@drtomprichard Sporadically but enough to annoy😒
Kevin Steen aka Kevin Owens in WWE you suck bro~ just because Cena put u over and u kissed HHH's ass doesn't make u a superstar YET
@DebraMessing @ThePandoraBoxx The legal statute of limitations has expired.  Has TLC lost its mind?  Cancel Duggars#
Give me classic tv; sports channel or my WWE network as the remainder of this stuff sucks!
@MilesPrevitire @RentMen_com Wow bro!!  :)
@scootdavis major crush on this guy
@scootdavis keep 'em cumming Scott :)
@WynonnaMusic you inspire me to try :)
@KurtWildXXX What dictated removal of your wedding ring- the studio or your preference?
@TheOnion this Paula Bailey is an idiot; plus she needs make-up.  It's hard to stomach her drivel when she is so frocking unattractive.
GET@fetishpigbottom
@TheGingerMinj You were stunning on last nights ep &amp; Untucked~😘

Oral arguements done; now hurry up and wait....for June~ Happy Tuesday!! Xo http://t.co/hLNmWm5WeO
WWE's Extreme Rules was full of great content but Main Event fell short....grrrr
WHOIS@TeaPartyReport
WWE's Fast Lane taking shape for this Sunday :). Finally!!
@MasturbateCTG My pleasure
@realjannetty @TheHistoryofWWE Congratulations and well deserved!!
@WWERoadDogg People in general try 2 project their stuff onto others regardless of its content; repel it. Glad ur here in this forum.
@WWECreative_ish  No dispute of that match = 5 star quality. Sadly u guys mucked up everything else on the card.
Sorry Vince Mcmahon but demote Steph &amp; HHH to on-air talents.  They are good in that capacity but not WWE mgmt.  2 PPVs in row- dismal.
@JRsBBQ  It was incredible and so informative. A book by the Cowboy would be a best seller &amp; must read for all wrestling fans!! Thanks JR
@WNSource  Stream is fine; its the content that poor.  Don't suppose you can help with that ? 😄
This NOC is pretty pathetic!  Good thing its part of my $9.99 pckg. Steph needs a stylist!!  You looked like hell lady
So enjoyed JR's podcast with Bill Watts.  He is an often misunderstood mogul with a mind for wrestling.  Your presence is sorely missed!
I'm no Miss State Fan but love seeing them give LSU hell; no other team deserves it more...dirty team players and their fans are THE worst.
@JRsBBQ In awe of the podcast with the legendary Stan Hansen~One of the best yet.  Thanks!!
"RIP Joan Rivers Rosenberg~ Loved by the masses who got the joke and thank u 4 the decades of entertainment.  Love 2 Melissa, Cooper &amp; family"
Not interested n all the bullshit fanfare over Brock Lesner- Overrated; sub-talented and oversold by the WWE...REFUND Please...xo

To the conservative members of the U.S. Supreme Court: kiss my ass fuckers!!
We are overdosing on Chris McDaniel here in MS~Ugh!!  Now national media is giving the ass more ATTN...Enough already- U LOST; STFU~~
@TheJimCornette @AliceRadley  Hey Guys; I'll be back to listen when the format is minus you know who...just sayin' :)
@JRsBBQ @JRsBBQ  For Sting- Easy or hard sell on transition from traditional Sting character to B&amp;W Darker version? #AskJR
@JRsBBQ  For Sting- Easy or hard sell on transition from traditional Sting character to B&amp;W Darker version?
