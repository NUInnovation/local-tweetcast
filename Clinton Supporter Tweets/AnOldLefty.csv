@amsmadwoman @ninaturner 2008 was a good election as we had a Dem SoS. She lost in 2010 statewide sweep.
@amsmadwoman @ninaturner She had her ass handed to her in SoS race in 2014. She's burned a lot of bridges here. We're looking to the bench.
@ninaturner better hope @BernieSanders wins as her political career in Ohio is over.
