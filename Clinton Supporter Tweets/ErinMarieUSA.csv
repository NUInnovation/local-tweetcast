How long have you practiced SGI? @londonlotus
what is up? @SPCwrite
I did a quick pick over here.  I hope I get something out of it. @SPCwrite
who here is interested in Nicherin buddhism?
His intensive study of the Buddhist sutras convinced him that the Lotus Sutra contained the essence of the Buddha's enlightenment
"Nichiren wondered why the Buddhist teachings had lost their power to enable people to lead happy, empowered lives"
"Nichiren was born in 1222 in Japan, a time rife with social unrest and natural disasters. The common people, especially, suffered enormously"
Who is Nicherin Daishonin?
"and the operation of cause and effect throughout the three existences of past, present and future."
#nam myoho renge kyo
"The term Buddha, or ""enlightened one,"" is applied to any human being who realizes the eternity of life and the operation of cause and effect"
I really want to change my karma and achieve my goals in life.
"If you Shakabuku you will achieve the equalvalent of 10,000 chants or daimoku"
If you chant Nam Myoho Renge Kyo you will have the power to change one's karma
"Nam Myoho Renge Kyo means ""Devotion through the mystic law of cause and effect through sound"""
The practice is from Nicherin Daishonin's Buddhism.  We chant Nam Myoho Renge Kyo.
Back to Shakabuku.  Shakabuku basicly means to introuduce someone into the practice.
I miss you.  I think you should get your own show@Jillzarin
I really want to change my karma
It is time for Shakabuku
I am going to go chant for a little bit and I may get back on if i have the ability.@SPCwrite
"With this recipe we will experience actual proof.  Actual proof would be like getting a better job, for example"
"There are three basics in applying your practice.. They are faith, practice, study."
Let us talk about beginning your practice
I have to get something to protect my keyboard.  My period is falling out @SPCwrite
http://t.co/jFUV48zFmy website for our organization
Nicherin was a wise and fearless man.  He was a 13th century practioner.
I practice Nicherin Daishonin's Buddhism.
I guess I will Shakabuku for the rest of the night.
It is easier to use a computer than my ipad. @SPCwrite

So r you having trouble with the peeps on twitter? @SPCwrite
Sorry I am not on as much as I should @SPCwrite
"@SPCwrite hey I""m here"
"We practice by chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo which stands for ""devotion to the mystic law of cause and effect through sound"
What is Nicherin Buddhist practice?
A peaceful world can only exist if people are happy--sgi
Time for Shakabuku!

Tomorrow SGI will have its big meeting tomorrow called Kosen- Rufu in Dallas
"also translated ""spread it abroad widely"""
Were you on a raw diet? @SPCwrite
Kosen- Rufu means world-peace
The great goal of SGI and Nicherin Buddhism is Kosen-Rufu
What is Kosen-Rufu?
Pretty good @SPCwrite
Sharing Buddhism requires courage
Time for shakabuku
"“@SPCwrite: Bacon night, made BLT club lol.”Chinese food for me"
shakabuku will continue later.
Gongyo is a practice that calls forth and activates the infinite power that the microcosm inherently possesses
this consists of chanting Nam Myoho renge kyo and reciting portions of the lotus sutra
"Gongyo which means ""to exert oneself in practice"""
Practice for oneself takes the form of twice daily observance in front of the Gohonzon called gongyo.
"Of the three basics- faith, practice, and study- practice for oneself and practice for others"
Gongyo: The Practice for Oneself
from the Essentials of Nicheren Buddhism Exam 2011
so it is time for Shakabuku
Time to Shakabuku
