Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers out there! #MothersDay
Brutal workout today.
Time for my morning run.
@DrCheriQuinn Awesome. I will check them out. Thanks!
"@DrCheriQuinn I'm kinda touchy about 2nd hand beds &amp; couches. I don't mind as much with tables, chairs, dressers, etc."
@DrCheriQuinn Renting furniture can be costly.
I bought a new bed today that I will most likely give away or donate in 11 months.
It's difficult shopping for furniture when I don't plan on staying in Durham-Raleigh beyond my 1 yr commitment.
I hope it works out. https://t.co/qpF0NwHhUw
I moved into my new apt this morning. https://t.co/uvZLK85ViV
Thanks David! @DavidSchantz @EvanStavisky @oldtimer1968 @AugustLady241 @colmant_ @stlwrkr4889 @JerryManderMan @Mary_Miskanis @bruntofitall
Muay Thai morning was good as always.
"Today, I signed the lease for my new apt."
"If Clinton &amp; Sanders split super delegates 50-50, Bern would still lose."
Tonight was a good night for Hillary. #ImWithHer
"I still think Hillary will end up 2,800+ total delegates."
Bernie will win a couple of more white states before HRC officially wins nomination.
@Motley_Drew88 Sore loser. It must suck for you that most Dems aren't buying Bernie bullshit. HRC is kicking his ass. hahahaha
@Motley_Drew88 Whatever stupid. Go read some history books.
@Motley_Drew88 She will not be indicted. Bernie is done. He will campaign for HRC or be ostracize in senate. Enjoy your misery.
@Motley_Drew88 That's how these things go. In 2008 HRC campaigned to elect Obama. Bernie &amp; Obama will campaign for HRC in gen election.
"@TheNFL_Chica2 I like him too, but tonight he is overstating Bernie's win in Indiana."
@Motley_Drew88 Unofficially Bernie's race is over.Once he officially exits race Dems can focus on gen election.Bernie will campaign for HRC.
Bernie Sanders is down by 10 touchdowns in 4th quarter. He kicks a field goal &amp; his minions think he going to win. wtf is wrong w/ them?!
"@Motley_Drew88 It won't happen. HRC  leads in pledge delegates &amp; popular votes plus she fund raises for down ticket Dems, Bernie doesn't."
Van Jones is a fool.
@Motley_Drew88 Bernie can win all 10 &amp; he will still lose b/c Clinton's delegate lead is insurmountable. He needs landslide wins in all.
Hillary can lose every state and still win the nomination. Her lead is insurmountable.
@Motley_Drew88 Bernie has already lost. He is just thru the motions until convention where he will embarrassed himself.
@Motley_Drew88 It's been over for a while. Kicking a field goal when you're down by 10 touchdowns does little. Remember to vote DEM in Nov.
Bernie close win in #IndianaPrimary does very little reduce to his huge delegate deficit.
After 4 days of exercise &amp; lots of muay Thai I am taking today off to rest my body.
