@Naughty_Dog Do you have plans of upgrading the graphics of UC4 before its release
@HillaryClinton You got my state Pennsylvania locked up.
@HillaryClinton Dang 74% to 25% with only 60% reporting that's sad

@remedygames Why are the Quantum Break PC requirements so dang high?
@The_CrapGamer Enough I have heard enough from you the last couple of days. Honestly you are giving a bad name to MS fans
@XboxP3 @Xbox I personally think bringing Xbox games to pc is very smart.
Hillary is ready to tackle the worst risks on Wall Street. We need a president who has a plan. #ImWithHer
@Joe_Sugg you look like death
@docm77 Clinton should have killed that 74 yr old socialist who wants life to be free
@CaptainSparklez Happy Bday
@HillaryClinton Don't worry your still leading @BernieSanders 392 to 42 when it comes to delegates. You still have the upper hand.
How are they calling winners to the #NewHampshirePrimary if not even 20% are reporting in?
@TheFakeTrump @HillaryClinton @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump very true and it's messed up trump should not be as successful as he is.
@TheFakeTrump @HillaryClinton @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump yea they are all idiots

#DemDebate Shit got real between @BernieSanders and @HillaryClinton thanks to @HillaryClinton saying If you've got something to say say it

Wow everyone in the media is out to prove why Hillary should have lost. Pathetic to say the least
@HillaryClinton eww shots fired 🔫🔫🔫
@NeilTurner_ @HillaryClinton ok I have really had enough of you. Do you just spend your time waiting to comment on these
@realDonaldTrump would he? It might mean more coming from someone who didn't loose the caucus big shot.
@crackdown race track
"@DigitalTrends That's Microsoft. ""Buy everything"" good job MS"
@HillaryClinton Congrats on the win
As of now @HillaryClinton is leading @SenSanders in the Iowa caucus by .2% with 99% reporting in. #ImWithHer #HillYes
@MorganGamesYT wow the audacity of some people (not you)

Oh god they just opened a @Walmart  near my house. Incoming the weird people.
@mandehbutton this is the exact model and color https://t.co/iPhB2QPw8j

@majornelson @TheDivisionGame heck ya
@McJuggerNuggets I'd eat that poop
@UbisoftSupport I bought the gold edition of The Division digitally over Xbox one. But whenever I try to play it says do you own this game
@PlayStation helldivers is great but otherwise wtf Sony you wonder why I hate you
When you accidentally involved all 4 factions in @Fallout 4 to a battle😁
@HillaryClinton @CoryBooker possible vp????
You know your addiction is bad when you turn down your friends to play Fallout 4
@BethesdaStudios It's 2:50 in the morning and I can't stop playing @Fallout 4

@HillaryClinton Americas doomed
@McJuggerNuggets @AirplaneExpert I hate MMM
Just found out @BernieSanders is 74!!! Isn't anyone afraid if he gets elected he will die from all the stress???
I hope @gloryandgoldrs sues @KEEMSTARx but he probably won't because he's a good man. But if he does I do not blame him.
"@GFuelEnergy I seriously recommend dropping @KEEMSTARx from your brand, over the past years he has been completely offensive and wrong."
@KEEMSTARx Screw you
@Shock301 @KEEMSTARx Hey bud watch keemstar exposed there is actual proof of his saying this shit
"Keemstar - Hypocrite, Racist, Psychopath. @GammaLabs  https://t.co/zV7BIUVeKR"

@RoseCityKingg I really wish I had a code
@THIRSTYWILKS Plzzzz
"I'm ready to quit gaming.... I just can't take all the fanboys, the hate, the shady company moves, and especially the biased media."
"@Xbox Gesrs cause I already own Forza, Tomb Raider, and Rare Replay"
@BrianHortonArt No thank you for creating such an immersive game
@BrianHortonArt Wow Rise of The Tomb Raider is officially my favorite game of all time!
@Microsoft Will Microsoft be at CES this year seeing that every other major tech company will be there?
@InfinityWard This is what I'll do to ghosts 2 of you make it this year https://t.co/bGHw1WirR9
@justenholstein @Gam3Newz I think it will
@justenholstein @Gam3Newz Microsoft is trying to make he Xbox more pc oriented offering power options would be smart
@justenholstein @Gam3Newz no I mean make it so where developers only have to do a slight bit more work to make 2 Xbox one versions.
@justenholstein @Gam3Newz This partnership has been going on for some time now I think they have found a way to fix that issue.
@justenholstein @Gam3Newz will have partnerships taking effect in Q2 2016 2/2
@justenholstein @Gam3Newz then why was it found in the Xbox one and why is amd actually making a new gpu architecture. Then saying they 1/2
"@justenholstein @Gam3Newz they will make the Xbox ""two"" in 3 or 4 years but look https://t.co/4sPcOaWFeu"
@justenholstein @Gam3Newz and microsofts gonna release a new console with new hardware that will balance out the Xbox one to play 1080p
@justenholstein @Gam3Newz wtf if you calculate all the sales of the Xbox one up from the npd it's almost 20 million consoles
@justenholstein @Gam3Newz proof?
@justenholstein @Gam3Newz and now it has sold more than 12 million
@justenholstein @Gam3Newz Hahahah what then how do you explain halo making over 400M in the first week
@Gam3Newz wow halos only on one console and it almost sold that in its first week let alone first 2 months
@ForzaMotorsport When Forza 6 was sold out at GameStop so you had to order it and it still hasn't come. 😕
@DfieldMark I have one resolution this year and I'm sticking to it.
@InfinityWard I don't like modern warfare nor ghosts but if you have to make a game make it modern warfare 4.
#HappyNewYear 2K16
Sick on New Year's Eve my life sucks.
@Xbox Mainly Rise of the tomb raider and just cause 3. A bit of halo on the side and a bunch more
"@Xbox Finally came in the mail, should compliment my elite controller very nicely. https://t.co/4fuxvhDKvF"
