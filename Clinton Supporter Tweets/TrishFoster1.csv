"Mitch the people had a voice when we elected President Obama by 5 million votes last election cycle. Sorry, but that dog don't hunt."
"""Thank you sir may I have another."" @maddow in regards to Carson's endorsement of Trump.... Yes indeed..."
My life in one tweet... https://t.co/xTlaoll9os
@Bourdain @jrezaian @YeganehSalehi  It's so good to see your smiling faces again! Welcome home.
"No TV. So I'll be getting my #GOPDebate highlights on Twitter tonight. SIA for excessive retweets, only frame of reference."
Oh no Stack Dash. Trainwreck. #Oscars
@BigbyTX haha https://t.co/DoPWwxunSO
@HamiltonPug A5 He couldn't sleep next to me in bed so he slept under the bed right under me when I was sick. Loyal and loved. #Pugchat
@HamiltonPug When Rocco tucks himself under the covers and his pugness lingers... So once a month. #Pugchat https://t.co/f2AIuD26zI
Epitome of irony.  https://t.co/XcbWdH7jCm
"Ok Ben Carson, let's leave Stalin out of this..."
Jesus Trump is worse than my 4 year old.
"Unemployment isn't at 40%. You don't get to make shit up because you aren't able to form intelligent, coherent arguments. So irresponsible."
Trump's speech is like watching a kid with ADHD trying to communicate.  Obamacare! Isis! Unemployment! Squirrel!!!
Does Hillary's voice sound a little hoarse? Like maybe she's been yelling at someone (or lots of someones)? Hmmm..
"Waiting to see who backs out first; Carson, Christie, or Fiorina.  They're all past their expiration dates."
The birther statistic is infuriating to hear 7 years into Obamas presidency. There is no legitimate argument for the Right to dispute him.
@RonLPitts Clinching my teeth during his analysis for that exact reason. That's a huge blemish on his credibility. Just Hush.
"The sea of whiteness at Trump's victory party is blinding. Nothing bad ever comes from ""those"" types of gatherings. #NHPrimary #notmyusa"
Shocker.. https://t.co/jT0GkYovDM

#Amen #IowaCaucus  https://t.co/LoRhKwO0z3
Lol. Truth. https://t.co/9u0qyZwC8i
"Hillary on stage during Cruz speech. Smart, and a much needed relief."
"Cruz acting like he won the presidency.  Take it down a notch, not a pulpit and you aren't the anointed one."
@va_northington The stuff that nightmares are made of. #runonsentences #grammarhell  https://t.co/stVEeHS2LJ
"2 different locations, waiting 30+ minutes each time and still haven't seen anyone. @BofA_Community why are your branches so poorly staffed?"

"Is it wrong when filling out daycare apps. I feel the need to put ""smart-ass"" under known medical conditions? Just trying to be honest here."
2 more weeks until school's out. Stocking up on mini bottles and copious amounts of craft supplies. This momma can multi-task. #helpme
@OverkillNeal Apparently you aren't the only one... https://t.co/OZnrE5gc9N
I'm still reeling and waiting for TLC to cancel #TheDuggars.  What could possibly be so hard about this decision? #justiceforhisvictims
Why is it necessary to stir the pot? We don't all have to worship the same but we do have to respect eachother.  https://t.co/Wrrcjv7drb
All hail the master.  #totallyjustified #nonoisemakersinthehouse  https://t.co/Cf94ixtVG6
@OverkillNeal We're going to miss him next season.... https://t.co/VrrY2j6gre
@AntheaButler @TLC Hopefully it is for good. It's unclear if they were just pulling from airing the show or canceling it.
Yep. Twilight Zone. Thanks for the heads up.  https://t.co/OdQrNmZyX3
Have we entered the twilight zone and nobody told me? What about his victims? Their rights and safety? #Duggars  https://t.co/C0iu51jdf1
"What kind of woman knowingly stays, marries, and has CHILDREN with a self confessed child molester? #disgust #duggarfamilyvalues #shameonyou"
Is there a statute of limitations as an accessory after the fact?  Can his parents be charged for failure to report? #duggarfamilyvalues
"The victims of #JoshDuggar should be receiving our attention and support. They count, they deserve a measure of justice."
"If you're a parent of a young child and knowing allow them around accused child molesters, there's a special place in hell for you.#Duggars"
"100% Accurate.  Why does their daughter's innocence, safety, and sense of well being matter less?  https://t.co/zgIiH71qJX"
All of this is about him. What about his victims? What has been taught to those girls about their worth?  https://t.co/BBolqMLUPP
