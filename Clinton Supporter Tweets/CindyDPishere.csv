@scifibird I hv FB friend who plans to vote for Stein if BS isn't Dem nom. Wonder what she might hv to say abt this. Doubt she'll say. SMH.

@Figment_Imagine you bet! But VT is still in love w him per most recent poll. Sad but true. @Braveswyn @AugiesGrammie @BobSmith4152
Trump rarely looks directly into a camera when doing an interview. He always looks sideways at it. But not bc he's shy...
@PaladinCornelia it's so telling that @berniesanders fans do this but HRC's don't. Shows exactly how this attitude comes from the top.

When Jerry &amp; I married he gave me 29 white roses-Turkowar filly's name was in honor of that. Irgun filly was named Catgotyirgun. #KyDerby
But Turkancer was victim of selenium poisoning via bad hay &amp; unable to breed so we went w Turkowar. We named the filly TwentyNine Roses...
"Turkancer's 1st several foals all raced &amp; won, &amp; a friend bought him to stand at MO farm, along w his son. We wanted to breed Mystic to him."
Turkancer was gorgeous black who never raced due to injury but became very successful upper level dressage horse who sired a few foals...
"In my landscape pic, Mystic Cat is w 2008 filly by Turkowar, by Turkancer, by Turkoman. Interesting story there: Turkowar was OH Horse of Yr"
"Mystic's grandsires were Storm Cat &amp; Majestic Light, whose sires were Secretariat &amp; Majestic Prince, both #KentuckyDerby winers."
"Irgun, sired by Derby winner Sunny's Halo, Secretariat &amp; Halo as grandsires. Our mare, Mystic Cat, was by Mountain Cat, 1st 2yo to win $2mil"
Irgun was unbeaten fave for 94 Derby but was injured wk b4. Vid above shows him beating eventual Derby winner Go For Gin in Wood Memorial.
"#KYDerby day so my day to talk about horses on my Twitter pg. In profile pic is our mare w 2005 filly by Irgun

"LOVE puppy predictors! Gary Stevens' horse--not a bad bet, lol. https://t.co/EDo8zAsFPG"
"Hubby's picks for #KyDerby are Brody's Cause, Nyquist, Exaggerator in various ex, tri boxes &amp; wheels."
"Putting my #KyDerby picks on record: Nyquist WPS; ex box w Nyquist, Exaggerator, Mohaymen, My Man Sam; show bets on Lani, Mor Spirit."
@cocoanutcake just make sure it's age appropriate. @amnmacn
