@BarackObama phone is tapped. FBI website will not work. Tweets being erased. No govt. shutdown. Has Senate voted on Judge Merrick Garland?
Everyday Americans need a champion - that's why @HillaryClinton is running for president. #Hillary2016 https://t.co/cSlVCJnbOR
@_metafizik Hillary's experience as First Lady gives her experience for unification and those ties protect the US from recession-depression.
My friend says his body is his temple and just like his home not everybody is welcome just like mind and mood altering drugs.
"My friend-arrested, incarcerated psychiatricly and forced to consume mind and mood altering chemicals even though he exhibited no illegality"
"My friend has said before ""I had a dream"""
My friend's psychotropic drugs eliminate his REM sleep and he prefers to live alone because men have violated his body after he's passed out
My friend's psychotropic drugs cause him to have no REM sleep. He prefers to live alone because men violate his body after he @
My friend was celebate for approximately 60 days and did not have any nocturnal emissions due to psychotropic drugs.

@HillaryClinton sexism is the worst form of bigotry leading to an extreme form of enmity and domestic violence or divorce.
"@csoghoian, The privacy act deters gossip. Terrorists don't use a lot of tape except for holidays that can be purchased at a dollar store."
"""To be or not to be, that is the question""
""I think, therefore I am"""
All men are created equal but we are not the same even though we think our friends great minds think alike.
My friend gets grief beyond belief everytime he hears about an entriggered suicide funeral that mental health workers don't attend.
My friends sadistic psychiatrist lied to SSA and forged his signature to steal $32 a month for harassment trying to get him arrested.
https://t.co/HA0luaSpPR
My friend knows his psychiatrist will be embezzling again in an effort to destroy the US Constitution by trying to get him ex-communicated.
My friend was psychiatricly incarcerated upon disagreeing with his psychotherapist when she said masterbation was healthy.
Psychotropic drug divisions perverted the word extacy when they created MDMA and it led to a lot of divorces as well as domestic violence.
My friend thinks psychiatrists judgemental ism and confusion might increase their zombie army destroying variety as the spice of life.
I'm so glad that steroids are banned from sports competitions
Affirmative Action and corporate tax breaks for highering minorites depletes competition as the American way of life.
"Jesus said we can eat anything. I believe in Jesus, but I don't eat arsenic or the renal glands of the African Green monkey."
@BritishMonarchyIwont play Eltons TheKingMustDie after you go heaven because I don't believe in book burnings.Idolikeburningsticksandfaggots
Some people say I've taken a vow of poverty. I have not. I would like the million dollars that goes along with a Nobel Peace prize.
The first church is so tall up to the sky like the leaning tour of piza except it doesn't lean.
Pentecost Sunday is when Jesus ascended to heaven like a whirlwind from the exact location where St. Peter built his church in Jeruselem.
"Jesus talked about lamb ,ram, and goat like people. I think he was talking about those that comprehend their Kaballas, Korans, and Bibles."
Very few get into heaven but Jesus instructed St. Peter to build the first Christian Church and all the other disciples promoted it.
Bible is an anagram for Basic Instruction before leaving earth.
"When reading the Bible,
 read all the letters pointing out other scriptures for his authoritative context."
Killing a homosexual is less offensive to God than committing a faggot like act.
God told me that Crime Against Nature or faggotry was punishable by death and how to spot a fag. NC law says it is a misdemeanor.
I hope NC's blasphemas Crime Against Nature law doesn't bring a plague worse than AIDS causing more US fatalities than everywhere else.
My friend had thought about running for president but because of the state of the environment won't take campaign contributions.
My friend thinks taxpayers aid and abbed his shrink because his main sources of income are chemical corportions and government contributions
Christians only have to take two slaps in the face before it becomes an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth.
They call solitary confinement observation rooms where they don't feel the onset of their confusion caused by their judgemental scutiny.
A mental health worker called for assistance because my friend refused their drugs then had to swallow them. They do oral cavity searches.
My friend moved to CA and was attacked by a psychiatrist who tried to murder him with a combination of drugs and thyroid medication.
The shrink thinks he is OK because the statute of limitations is up. With that crime I don't think there is one.
The shrink that covered up my friends LSD traces before his forced psychiatry stalked him from NC to GA so no one would find out.
"Afriend'smothertookhimforaMyersBriggs testoneday,acatscanthenext,thensheputliquidLSDinhis drinkonthewaytoaninsaneasylum.Hewasforceddrugs."
No obedience to the 11th commandment is why before people start calling the humane society to report human cruelty there will be only Jews.
"I wish my friend was accepted for all of his eccentricities, likes, dislikes, personality, IQ, beatitudes, and absolution."

#DYK more than 86 million American adults have #prediabetes? Take the test at https://t.co/EBRK9Xr3n0 to find out if you’re one of them.
I know human beings that have one rite listed in The Bill of Rights and live forcibly and oppressed under the poverty line in the USA.
Psychotropics will always only be able to effect areas of the brain like street drugs. Since Bellvue they color them and call them names.
Psychiatrists say that the reason mentally ill people die 20 years prematurely is because of the drugs they perverted lyrics feed patients.
