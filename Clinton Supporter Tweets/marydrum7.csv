@ShalyahFearing what song are you singing next week!? Can't wait!
"#berniedesperate he reflects poorly on the Democratic Party by attacking Clinton. Stop, before we stop loving you for your humility. #unite"
@BernieSanders have you not looked at your donors? You too have gun lobby people donating to your campaign.
@SenSanders we stand for someone who is not so desperate that all they do is bash Clinton. #sandersdesperate
@GMA @BernieSanders Bernie sanders has also gotten over $54000 from people who work in the fossil fuel industry. Any excuse to bash Clinton
"@Mimzy122 @nana_mo_Amelika Bernie Sanders,received $13,000 from employees of the oil and gas industry. Does that mean he broke pledge?"
@Mimzy122 @nana_mo_Amelika .  She admits to getting money from individuals working in fossil fuel companies. No $ donated from ff industry.
"@BernieSanders when you criticize Hillary's connection to Wall Street, you seem desperate. You're both great, so respect each other."
"If Millennials actually understood Socialism, would they still support Bernie Sanders? https://t.co/cbfOrmAcYc"
"@fordoers what he says is all good, but highly unrealistic, especially when you have a republican congress."
@nickdimorohere are you complaining about the lower gas prices?
@intelligencer seriously!!! That's what I said !
@FoxNews @SenSanders that's true about everything in life. Please stop talking about Wall Street sanders. Stop living in a bubble
#DemDebate  no one among all candidates supports African Americans and Hispanics more than Hillary. She has proven herself over time
@realDonald. Trump after you changed the name.
@85thLegislature @realDonaldTrump that's because it was closed more than 3 years ago. Last review in 2010 .
@megynkelly @FrankLuntz . Kasich was the winner . Can't believe people think trump won that debate #GOPDebate
