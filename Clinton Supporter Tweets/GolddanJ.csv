Read btw the lines....
@JenGranholm @realDonaldTrump No self conscious immigrant will vote for Trump. See what happened in Florida with Marco the Golden boy.
@HillaryClinton @jimmyfallon the character Fallon
"Yes, John Boehner.. Cruz shut-down the government. He is a character in the walking Dead. Lucifer!"
"First Ever a woman nomination, and first president.."
"This year Dr Evil will see Democrats at the polls like no other time, even more than PUTAS two record turn outs. Remember!"
Do not under estimate the Democrats.
"Bring it on Dr Evil.. Dems not playing games at the poll.. We may not have enough time to vote in mid-term elections, but Presidential!"
"Quote: we Democrats believe in the rights. Right to vote, women rights, LGBT rights, Equality for all Americans.. HRC"
"Pennsylvania, yes in the column.. HRC"
"@sfjvoyrf2 yes! We do pay attention to what happening globally, but right now my focus is on home.. Thank you"
Yes Delaware! Bring it in the house.. HRC
Maryland in the house. Victory
"Victory is near, if HRC wins those primary states to day Sanders has no choice, but to campaign against himself.."
"Trump (Dr Evil)is so ridiculous, his campaign has nothing of substance to say.. He echoes rant all through his rallies."
Women for Hillary! Get out the vote for HRC.
"A man who shut down the government, causing the country more money to restore cannot be our president."
"Common sense gun control people, too many lives are cutting short to gun violence."
"HRC should use your gun control measures votes against you Bernie. I don't know why she hasn't, when you are using trade issues against her."
This world depends on trade #Sanders2016
If Bernie sanders against every trade agreement this country have negotiate. Where would we be? Then we would be left out in the world.
"Two decades of buried past, she brings up into the minds of voters. I wanna see, and hear Bernie condemn that comment."
She is tasteless. We will boycott any movies she get cast into
This Dawson is so damn petty.. little actress..
"We Dems have a get out the vote machine, and this year it will in the like of nothing you've seen before.."
"When HRC wins the nomination all Democrats will rally, and support her nomination.#CNN"
"Yes, yes!!"
Yes New York!!
"New York, New York!! Let's make History once again..."
That's a no brainer.. Oxymoron!
"Why would the rich not want to pay more taxes? They pay less, then at the end of the year the get more in returns than those who pay taxes.."
"Standing strong with HRC.. Follow my lead people, let's do this."
New Yorker's Florida stands firm with HRC. Will you?
"HRC for America.. Floridians has deliver, New York answer this call to deliver New York  to HRC.."
"Let's get the ball rolling Dems, and just remember, that there is one candidate that can, and will bring about the changes, we need.. HRC"
I need Primary States to start thinking what is at stake this November..
"Deliver New York, and you will see continued success in the Empire State.."
"New York, Florida has deliver The Primary to ""HRC"" this two states have much in common.. Both known for their diversification.."
Dr Evil debating the moderator Anderson Cooper..
"Trump campaign manager is scalabush!! Oh Florida, MyFlorida why are you so kind to Trump?"
We need to get our ground game and voting machine out for the rest of the Primary states..
Hawaii better wake and vote HRC
Why are the caucuses states voting for sanders?#DemCaucus
Democrats needs to get out and vote in the primaries already..
Sanders are not going to be a good President! He is too far left.. He is not open to compromise.. #DemPrimary
We need primary states to hurry and close this deal... Caucuses are not as the primary..
Democrats just do not like going to vote in the primary elections.. We need to give them a reason to do this before it's too late..
"Eight years ago Washington voted Hillary, please do the same today..."
Vote Hilary Washington..
A centeres
"TBT a lot of things HRC will get done when she becomes President the Burnie Sunders can't, and won't be able to do. Cause he is not"
Moving forward to general election. Democrats let's keep our eyes on the prize... HRC
There is no powerful tool than a face to face convinced to the fact on HRC advocacy on important issues and a pioneer of universal Health C.
