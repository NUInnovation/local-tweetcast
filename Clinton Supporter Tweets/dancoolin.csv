"@NeverTrumpin16 Way to go to the California protesters! Even tho he made it to the event, you guys made it difficult, nice job!!"
@NeverTrumpin16 Keep fighting the fight and keep getting the word out! His views are dangerous and wants to be pres to serve is own needs!
@realDonaldTrump That's funny coming from someone who is more dishonest!!
"@realDonaldTrump Way to go to the California protesters! Speaking of crossing the border, you should cross the border and not come back!"
"@realDonaldTrump FYI we are already putting a stranglehold on ISIS, the media doesn't publicize it enough!"
"@johnpilarchik @realDonaldTrump Don't worry, look forward to 4 years of Hillary. Trump has no clue on foreign policy and social issues!!"
@NeilTurner_ @HillaryClinton That's much better than a guy who lies outright like Donald Trump! He's only wants to be pres to serve himself!
"@SadeABC @ABC7NY That totally sucks! Wake up people, he will destroy our country!!"
@Shanice_Jordyn You rock any dress no matter the color and that dress confirms what an angelic goddess that you are!!
"@VMurdockTV @BurrellTV Way to recognize Liberty! Our small Sullivan County towns are really on the map, lol!"

@realDonaldTrump @wdct8110 That's a bunch of crap! He's only going to do what's right for himself. People need to see that!!!
"@realDonaldTrump If its rigged, then give some delegates back!!"
"@realDonaldTrump You can stop talking about a rigged system. If you only have 37% of votes, you should only have 37% of delegates not 46%"
@SadeABC Wishing you a very happy birthday and enjoy time off! Another year and you are as beautiful as ever!! https://t.co/J8AMNucJtt
@hollyrpeete Wow!! Simply amazing! Brings me all the way back when I had a crush on you when you were on Hangin with Mr Cooper!!
@TanjaTWCNews @GovHowardDean So true!! Go Hillary!!
"@KeithOlbermann @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost Way to go Keith! Keep getting the message out, sooner or later, people will understand!"
"@TanjaTWCNews Trump has no idea on social issues and foreign policy! He will favor the rich, destroy our country and screw the middle class"
@realDonaldTrump Rigged? Only have 37% of all votes cast but 46% of delegates? That is rigged because you have more than you should!
@Shanice_Jordyn Simply amazing!!
"@wpdhfm Boris, sounds like you should come to Hannaford! Fast, friendly service without solicitations for donations or store cards!!"
"@BurrellTV Way to go John, vote Burrell! Actually, if there was a Miss America primary, Janelle wins, lol!!!"

@AdrianneHaslet Greetings from NY! Hope you are doing well and yr incredible beauty makes the world a more beautiful place!!
@KeithOlbermann You are so right that Trump is a dangerous candidate! Please use yr influence to spread the word!!!
"@WoodmanStudio Hey Wood, you sound like you on the Trump train and if so, I hope it runs up your ass!!!"
"@realDonaldTrump Wow, keep up the crap Republicans!! You guys are making the choice real easy and the Dems will kick your butts!!"
"@McConnellPress Go ahead Republicans, keep up the crap being unreasonable and you will get your butts kicked in November!!"
@McConnellPress We have to wait almost a full year to pick another justice? Not what the founding fathers had in mind #DoYourJob
"@CNN @DualGrey Way to go Kasich!! Congrats, people need to listen to your message and see that its way better than Trump!!"
@realDonaldTrump Of course Donald will pay the fees for the white guy
@realDonaldTrump Make sure you call the white Trump supporter who hits a black protester a thug too. No racism there huh!
@JeffJlpa1 Make sure you call the white Trump supporter who hits a black guy a thug too. No racism there huh!
@TVRobNelson Well said Rob!! Trump's rhetoric encourages this behavior! We must do our talking at the voting booth and not let him win!!
"@realDonaldTrump To the protesters, let's make sure we do our talking at the voting booth and make sure he doesn't win!!"
"@realDonaldTrump Take responsibility for what you say, one min you encourage to knock the crap out of him, the next min, yu say the opposite"
@ABC @joebergeon I never heard Trump denounce the David Dukes endorsement. He is only running to boost his own ego and serve his own needs!
@ABC @joebergeon The things going on at the Trump rallies are indicative of this man's hateful rhetoric. His supporters need to see this!
"@SarahPalinUSA @realDonaldTrump Attacks on ISIS strongholds, now we have a list of ISIS fighters, Nice job Obama!!"
@realDonaldTrump He must have learned from you!!
"@BurrellTV Nice montage!! But Janelle is the real lady in red, lol!!"
@SwinCash Watched the pregame and you look absolutely incredible tonight!!
@ErinAndrews Maybe so but that's bs to get that much money out of it.
@thehill Are you kidding? Debating about penis size? Why doesn't the Donald just prove it? They're all losers except maybe Kasich!

@jslaternyc @hollyrpeete @ShaunKing That's BS! Trump's followers are the same as Trump himself! We can't let that man get elected!
"@tedcruz You need to join forces with Rubio. Right now, put your delegates together and you would be leading Trump 321-315!!"
@tedcruz You need to join forces with Rubio. Right now put yr delegates together and you would be leading 321-315!!
"@BurrellTV Perfect, all the more reason not to vote for them!!!"
"@ErinAndrews As an employee of ESPN, maybe you should pose for the Body Issue!!"
"@realDonaldTrump To Super Tuesday voters, we can't allow this man to be president!!"
@BurrellTV Disturbing story this morning but the beautiful lady in red looking amazing as always!!

@NCTrump @realDonaldTrump That's why the more intelligent rocket scientists will be voting for Hillary!!
"@ChaserCharlie @brokencup @HillaryClinton Wake up, say what you want but Hillary will be the best candidate and we have to continue progress"
"@HillaryClinton Amen to that!!! We can't let Trump in office, he will create world instability and gas will be over $4 a gallon again!!"
"@realDonaldTrump Average IQ of a Trump supporter- under 100, that's why Sarah Palin is on board!!!"
@HillaryClinton Go Hillary 2016!!!
"@DTurn12 @HillaryClinton Ask the Republicans, esp Bush they're the ones who put us in debt and we are still trying to dig out!!"
"@CongCulberson You republicans are unbelievable!! You guys must think mass shootings are OK. Regulation must happen, nice job Obama!!!!"
@HillaryClinton Trump's dangerous views will only cause instability and first result will be $5 a gallon gas! Be happy with the positives!
