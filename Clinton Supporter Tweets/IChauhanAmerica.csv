Disgusting BS #LGBTrights  https://t.co/xNzQizCTA0
"#castle is all about the pairs, get that straight @Castle_ABC"
@jdmeac @manofmanychins alright this has gone on far enough. You have no right to judge what I understand or I don't. I'm done here.
@phuckthestate how so?
Any  music programs in #bhopal between 8th and 11th? #classicalmusic
@manofmanychins I did not miss the point and I did clearly state that there was no equitable scenario in two situations compared
"@phuckthestate just because the criminals don't obey, does that mean that we not make any laws but make more criminals?"
"@phuckthestate I'm aiming at stricter regulations so that_______ doesn't get filled up with criminals,druggies,religious fanatics,kids,teens"
"@phuckthestate still doesn't mean every Tom, Dick or Harry should have a gun."
@phuckthestate accidents..
He's a fine one to be talking of demeaning statements! #NeverTrump  https://t.co/OtPD95Klgx
"@phuckthestate you're lucky, although we can't assume the same for all. The danger is far too great. Innocent lives maybe lost for no reason"
"@phuckthestate yes very true, but the age group of  through 10 is still under danger. They're too young tho understand the stuff"
True that. So do I https://t.co/oMpRCXR16F
"@phuckthestate Educationist the key, I agree."
"@phuckthestate we always keep such things in lock n key, by the time it's out n loaded, too late. But you do expose to unwanted accidents"
Amazing @BarackObama You're awesome man! https://t.co/04QVX2OYnR
Absurd. https://t.co/EpVePMoMjB
@phuckthestate are you equating shoes and guns? Seriously?
@phuckthestate you don't live in the 21st century?
@phuckthestate all the above are needs whereas this isn't
@MissMalini it's really sad that they broke up. They were so good together.
@CNN of course he was. What if he wasn't? Who cares?
Disgusting https://t.co/ni2pLfqMVc
"@phuckthestate I told the other as well, logic doesn't escape me, but my perception of logic is different."
"@phuckthestate as I said, I'm all far sitter regulation on that as well, similar stand for guns no need to have one just 'cause"
"@phuckthestate all the others who I was having this 'fight' with were getting increasingly offensive, that's why I backed out."
"@phuckthestate I agree it's a whole lot, guns just have a wider affect scope, I think I agree for stricter regulation to alcohol as well"
"@phuckthestate the difference being that alcohol is not that big of an issue, like gun violence"
@phuckthestate Every action has an opposite reaction. Agreed. Doesnt mean we allow free flow.
@phuckthestate The goal is that criminals don't get guns easily and also that common people don't go down the wrong path
@phuckthestate disarmament is not the goal. Stricter regulation of arms is.
"@phuckthestate definitely not. Again I say, that any right should be exercised  within reasonable grounds"
@DemonTwoSix that's your thinking not mine. I'm not wrong. We are just different.
@DemonTwoSix What's wrong with the sitar here?
"@towerclimber37 I'm not paying you jack. We all have the second amendment rights. All I'm saying is, it should be done in moderation"
@Jeff257 you're no one to call me a dumbass. Be civil please.
@DemonTwoSix which country do you think my country is?
@towerclimber37 neither do you.
"@jdmeac you are easing it up for criminals to gain access to guns, ever think about that?

it's a discussion Be polite please"
"@towerclimber37 I'm very well aware of the second amendment, my interpretation of reasonable restrictions is different than yours. No biggie"
@jdmeac what I debate is for ending unneeded violence. Do yo wish to continue or we end saying that we agree to disagree?
"@DemonTwoSix also, the second amendment is subject to restrictions"
@Jeff257 @DemonTwoSix no thanks.
"@DemonTwoSix you don't even know me, so whatever. You can ignore my tweets"
"@jdmeac listen, you guys are members of the NRA so, we will never come to a common ground. How about we stop this here. Its a endless debate"
@DemonTwoSix what are you trying to say?
@jdmeac there have been many an instance where having guns has led to children mistakenly shooting their adults
"@jdmeac the possibilities do senseless violence are much more than actual protection for eg, of it comes into the hands of a kid"
@Jeff257 @jdmeac at least illegal activity has a possibility of punishment for violence. This will immunize them. Senseless violence!
@jdmeac what kind of danger are you in at a church? Are we in IS territory?
@jdmeac  are you serious? Can you even imagine the consequences? One guy shoots another because of a silly girlfriend spat and many more..
@jdmeac the scope of a country is a hell of a lot wider than a house.
@jdmeac law abiding like those who have allowed guns in churches?
@jdmeac @manofmanychins remodeling a house is very different than running a country. No possible equation.
"The base is there, iRights and freedom of people. A 200 y/o constitution doesn't make sense so many years later. https://t.co/llffDy1qxa"
@manofmanychins  I was referring to the other guy. I'm all for a living constitution. It's what makes sense.
@jdmeac stricter gun laws isn't jeopardizing the liberty of the people.
@jdmeac you don't think that it is necessary to amend considering we have the highest of gun deaths in the world?
"@jdmeac why should it be so hard, aren't the situations and times changing?"
"@jdmeac it's evident that they are. Bills to abolish overtime pay, bible as state book, #HB2 etc. #notethesarcasm"
"@jdmeac in two hundred years, 27 amendments, in approx 70 yrs 100 in India. That's how welcoming the Congress is of amendments"
"@jdmeac hundred times the population, much more diverse, is impossible to govern with mainly Christian thinking in constitution."
"@jdmeac at least agree to hear him out and then give a negatory vote, but stop Bing so bull headed."
@jdmeac basically an originalist. All I'm saying is that the constitution must change in time like the people it's governing have changed
"@jdmeac you very conveniently react to the part, you have an argument to. Why didn't. You respond to the second part of my reply to you?"
"@jdmeac I know very clearly what the constitution is, the difference between us is, you're from Scalia's school, while I'm from Ginsburg's"
"@jdmeac  What is his job then? When he is doing his job like the scotus nomination, brainless republicans refuse to give him a shot!"
"@jdmeac what has been done, is an ordinance to control,the free flow of weaponry with a view of curtailing unwanted deathsWhat is wrong?"
"@jdmeac if you are opposing me on this, you will also say that abortion should be illegal, right? Because of the so called rights of unborn?"
"@jdmeac what did you expect @POTUS to do, nothing, while more and more people died in unwanted and unneeded gun violence?"
"@jdmeac I don't need to look them up, trust me."
@jdmeac the constitution was framed over200 years ago. It's impossible to govern current society with the same #ordinance
"@jdmeac Says who that they give opinions only? If so, how do you explain gay marriage ruling, or BushvGore,plannedparenthoodVcasey?"
@jdmeac they aren't brainless only in this matter but many others like @SCOTUSnom #MerrickBGarland
"@jdmeac A 2nd amendment ruling by SC, ""the govt may impose restrictions on ownership""increased deaths and no action by congress forced him."
"Even then, brainless republicans want to blindly oppose @BarackObama's measures for #guncontrol  https://t.co/wpLBNcRBUj"
@SCOTUSnom  https://t.co/n9ZKYwZFSo
