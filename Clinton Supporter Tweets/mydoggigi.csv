@Reuters let's see his tax returns.
@tlwtexas @cscstars wouldn't keep retweeting this info.
"@cherokeesher2  ""the Democrats"" not we?"
@coniinthegarden @MarkRuffalo that's just dumb.  Too much time with you. Bye
@coniinthegarden @MarkRuffalo @MichaelSkolnik @JHWeissmann @BenSpielberg  Bernie has been there since 1990. He must be corrupt too.
@coniinthegarden @MarkRuffalo @MichaelSkolnik @JHWeissmann @BenSpielberg cause GOP fought against it. We were lucky to ACA thru.
@coniinthegarden @MarkRuffalo @MichaelSkolnik @JHWeissmann @BenSpielberg Ginsburg/Breyer - Bill Clinton. Sotomayer/Kagan - Obama. Anti CU.

@TrivWorks. And I'm sure Trump loves Hispanic jockeys too.  ðŸ˜‰ #NeverTrump
"@cameron_stell   It does.  I knew Donald Trump was a creep. However, always thought Sen. Sanders was a decent man. Not anymore. #bullies"
@princessomuch @goprapebuster Bernie lost his way. Started with campaign stealing HRC proprietary info and blaming HRC. He's a mean guy.

@plutoniumpage @JerrryOlson wonder why?
@bannerite @CSAresu @Toure  I'm hoping majority of junior high school boys have more respect for women than those Bernie supporters.
@cjewel this is exactly why we must elect HRC as POTUS and Democrats.  Our right to control our bodies is under attack by GOP. #ImWithHer

@jcuddlebugs @Obamaispres @marc_vinson @Amy_Siskind   Yes like that NYDN interview. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
@jcuddlebugs @Obamaispres @Amy_Siskind  are you saying you're not a Democrat? Or are you saying Republicans will vote for HRC? Or both?

@bluejoni @Merlin333 @realDonaldTrump  my 3 yr old grandson is more mature than Trump. Trump's bully in schoolyard. Time to take him out.
@owillis @raffstr did they know Trump wants to pay less than worth on Treasury Bonds? Might give HRC bigger lead for economy. He's disaster.
@Merlin333 @joshmom1 @realDonaldTrump  his hair? ðŸ˜‰

@UAProgressives @Obamaispres @Amy_Siskind that doesn't change that HRC is our nominee.
