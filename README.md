## What if Twitter decided this election?

### Local Tweetcast is a data-heavy application that predicts the outcome of political elections based solely on the local's twitter sentiment.

Current progress on this application includes determining what features of twitter users and tweets correspond to candidate preferences. We have collected a corpus of words associated to each candidate. This corpus will be used to predict the poltical favor of a certain locality.

Our next step is to allow for localities to be searched for and predictions to be created.
