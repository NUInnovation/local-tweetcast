### What if Twitter decided this election?

Local Tweetcast is a data-heavy application that predicts the outcome of political elections based solely on the local's twitter sentiment.
 
### How it Works

Users will enter a location their are intersted in seeing the politic preferences of. The application will take a sample of tweeters located in that local. From those tweeters, our system scours their most recent tweets, and looks for candidate leaning terms. From this, a city political composition is created. This dashboard of information is then displayed to the user.
