@wilw Glad to see a celebrity not staying silent to stay popular.
@HillaryClinton why did you have to evolve when @BernieSanders knew what was right decades ago? As a lesbian and feminist I don't trust you.
@johndegarson @50th_President @HillaryClinton There are million$ of reasons I'm not voting 4 Hillary and a video is not one of them.
@johndegarson @50th_President @HillaryClinton  Where can I find the full language of bills? The amendments on bills need to be apparent.

@HillaryClinton  You can't use Universal Healthcare as a positive and a negative in the same debate. Do you think we're stupid? #DemDebate
"@HillaryClinton, your vagina is not running for president. #DemDebate #FeelTheBern"
@HillaryClinton Make up your mind. You can't be a moderate and a progressive. Here's a clue you're a moderate. #DemDebate #FeelTheBern
@BarackObama  supporting the TPP makes him a moderate. #sorrynotsorry #DemDebate #FeelTheBern
Bernie Sanders is a progressive and you are not @HillaryClinton . Neither are most Democrats. Compromise is different than selling out.
The difference between speeches tells so much. #IowaCaucus #FeelTheBern #IntegrityMatters
