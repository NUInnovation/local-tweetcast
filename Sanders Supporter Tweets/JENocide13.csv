@SenatorCantwell @ErnestMoniz #stopTPP
Sign the pledge and promise you #WontVoteHillary! https://t.co/4JVEBQpWe7 #NotWithHer #NeverHillary via @spencerthayer
@hillaryclinton you are delusional if you think we are uniting behind you. Your supporters will vote blue but #Bernie's are #BernieOrBust
"@hillaryclinton, how can you count direct votes when so many have caucused? U R forgetting our votes. Oh wait, that's right. you don't care."
"@hillaryclinton. We all know you won't contradict the president, you took everything GWBush said at face value when he bought your war vote"
@hillaryclinton YOU ARE 100% THE ESTABLISHMENT.  You hide money offshore and you want the status quo. you are a corporatist neocon.
"@hillaryclinton 100% of citizens will have healthcare or only those without?  I want single payer, not a commercial system. You don't get it"
@hillaryclinton is dick cheney in a pantsuit
Maybe @hillaryclinton should be held accountable for all the children &amp; women and civilians that were killed b/c of war she profited from
@hillaryclinton:  throw children out there again.They don't win you the argument when you have sought wars killing millions of children.
@HillaryClinton supports America continuing as the world's police force and pushing our way on all other countries &amp; us paying for all of it
@hillaryclinton riding Obama's coattails until she needs to blame him for HER actions. $he's like a toddler that doesn't take responsibility
#NYDebate is@hillaryclinton campaigning for herself or Obama? #feelthebern #hiLIARy #hillno #environmentalistsforbernie #BernieorBust
"@Hillaryciinton.  Stand on your own feet. stop riding Obama's coattails.  A leader is what Bernie is, he has stood up to the status quo."
"@hillaryclinton You have the worst judgement, including in how you run your campaign.  We see through your games and lies.  #Bernieorbust"
"@hillaryclinton.  enough of the rhetoric, he did answer the ?s correctly, maybe it's you that has no clue!"
"@LeonardGilbert2 he's not proposing socialism like that. People MUST contribute to the ""community"" just cuz UR rich doesn't make you exempt."
@LeonardGilbert2 when and by whom?
@LeonardGilbert2 a lot more than anyone else. He's not In it to get rich off our kids starving &amp; our people struggling. He's not a sell out
"@LeonardGilbert2 that's what I said in the original reply,  that we allowed the corps to take over our government"
"@LeonardGilbert2 @Morning_Joe corporate way = TPP, NAFTA, CAFTA, CISA, Panama papers, tax loopholes. A govt that favors corps over people."
"@HillaryClinton: a despicable person to whom ALL that matters is power &amp; using ppl when @ worst to line her pockets.
https://t.co/tZ1QWXlzzV"
@LeonardGilbert2 @Morning_Joe stupidity b/c we've allowed this to happen &amp; not stood up to PUBLIC SERVANTS &amp;made them do the will of people.
"@LeonardGilbert2 @Morning_Joe @BernieSanders No, the corporate way, greed &amp; corruption of OUR PUBLIC SERVANTS is what got us where we are!"
@jashsf @originalgriz @xdelmar59 I didn't raise a dumb ass... she supports #bernie
"@jashsf @originalgriz @xdelmar59 actually, team #Sanders offers my dtr opportunity, hope &amp; a gr8 future. $hill offers nothing new. #hillno"
@nolywill @originalgriz and my dtr can expect if she works 30+ yrs in congress ALWAYS fighting for what's right that she isnt qualified?!?!?
@SenatorCantwell if this is how you feel then you would endorse @BernieSanders but you endorse the corp machine that never wants equality.
Factories that closed thanks to â‚¬linton trade deals... #BernieOrBust https://t.co/BXL3ngBgtG
@MBesterman @HillaryClinton don't expect her to lower her standards and come talk to you unless you've got the cash in hand. #BernieOrBust
"@ofunneculture $he doesn't ""got this"". $he's lost 7 of 8, AZ fraught w/ suppression &amp; south won't matter, they will vote repub in general."
@HillaryClinton @BernieSanders $hillary refusing to speak after #bernie won WI is = to a 2 year old having a temper tantrum. #NotaLeader
"If #Bernie 's tone is so bad, why not debate him &amp; let him sink his own ship?... b/c $he's running scared &amp; $he knows we are winning #HillNo"
"$he's still remaining silent, but now on election fraud &amp; voter suppression in AZ and who knows where else. #HillNo  https://t.co/CiT4PztGfl"
"@Jenasummerlin @SDzzz @MonaB2010 @Kayluvsredwings @DNCWomen we need THIS man, not a poor excuse of a woman who's capitalizing on her vagina"
https://t.co/hHho1cYiwE I love @TimBartender. Thanks for this enthusiastic reaction to WA &amp; AK.  That's exactly how we feel in WA. #Bernie
"getting cranked out for #WAcaucus  #WAForBernie... listening to all my anticorruption and anti-establishment songs.

@DosSieta @StephenKATU @SenSanders it's going to make your life better when they pay taxes. Try reading his plans it's all outlined
@StunnerSYoung @PappyKorn @washdems I saw that was happening... thanks for heads up.. mine is the same. #WAelection
"With cheating and election fraud @HillaryClinton won the last state $he will ever ""win"".  It's #Bernie all the way now!!!"
@Ruderealism I'm newer to twitter... lol... but I've been writing in my own candidates for president since 1988... lol
"@Ruderealism oh I've been here for a long, long time.."

"@TYTNetwork ... it's not new, he's been promising executive order re:immigration reform"
"@PattyMurray @SenatorCantwell you would do well to stand w/ your constituents after our voices are heard on Sat, 3/26. You're replaceable!"
"@PattyMurray... start looking for a new job, your time in Senate is coming to an end. Your constituents #feelthebern https://t.co/7Ol5OF4a9b"
@CindyR33d @kuorumorg I don't want anything to do w/ the corp $hill. I won't vote for her no matter what. #SheLies  #BernieOrBust
