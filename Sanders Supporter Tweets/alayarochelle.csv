I honestly don't think I could vote in a Trump-Clinton election regardless. I'd rather walk the plank.
"in my mind, at this point, it's lookin like 4 years of Trump vs 8 years of Clinton.

is anyone else seeing this?"
"however, if Trump is elected president in 16, Bernie can win the dem nomination in 20. &amp; so you think that fool is gonna get re-elected? no."
if Clinton is elected president in 16 she'll be the Democratic nominee in 20. &amp; she might get reelected. no opportunity for Bernie in that.
if anyone can guess where I'm going w this you're probably like woah girl don't hurt yourself.
"despite what happens in this election year 2016, my priority remains getting Bernie Sanders elected. &amp; that means I have to think long term."
I hate them both. so much. trump is a racist idiot. Clinton is an evil elitist reptilian shapeshifting bitch.
"so..... imagining that the FBI doesn't indict Hillary Clinton &amp; she wins the nomination, we are supposed to choose between her &amp; Trump."
I'm sitting in class thinking about how Bernie Sanders might not win the nomination for the Democratic Party this year. &amp; what that means.
