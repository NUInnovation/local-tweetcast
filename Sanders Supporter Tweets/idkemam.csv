sexual abusers fucking disgust me. to physically and mentally ruin people in such ways and then convince themselves it wasnt their fault
1 in 4 women will be victims of sexual assault at least some time in their life so dont go telling me that rape is not a fucking issue
women AND men that are victims of sexual assault should never EVER be treated as though it was their fault. it is NEVER the victims fault
disgusting. women should never be treated as the lesser figure on the subject of rape

IT IS THE ABUSERS DECISION TO SEXUALLY ABUSE IT IS NO ONE ELSES FAULT BUT THE ABUSER IT IS NEVER THE VICTIMS FAULT
WOMEN SHOULD NOT HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR OF MEN NOR SHOULD THEY LIVE IN FEAR OF RIDICULE FOR A MANS DECISION TO SEXUALLY ABUSE
NO WOMAN ASKS TO SEXUALLY ABUSED I REPEAT NO WOMAN ASKS TO BE SEXUALLY ABUSED
"the moment a woman steps up against years of sexual abuse she is considered an ""attention seeker"" or she was ""asking for it"""
