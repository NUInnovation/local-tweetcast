@LiteraryRambles SET UP A CAMERA. That's actually super disturbing wow
God.
"I'm breathing, I'm fine, just let me ride it and not interrupt it, okay, that's the skillful thing to do okay just let me fucking calm down."
I NEED to push this out I need to expel this energy because I'm gonna freakin lose it. Please just let me rant and rant and rant please
"And that's fine! But the fact that it had to be explained, the reason, I am so upset right now and I can't freakin just YELL it!"
"I had to tell somebody how the word ""monkey"" can be used as a slur towards poc. Someone came into MY inbox and demanded I explain"
JFC someone just INDULGE ME WHEN I YELL! I JUST WANNA YELL AND HAVE THAT BE OKAY. I don't wanna calm down! I wanna expel this frustration!
@NaNoWordSprints Jasmine! *jazz hands*
"K, gonna go keep some promises now. And maybe get some writing done too"
YOOOOO HARRIET TUBMAN'S GONNA BE ON THE TWENTY DOLLAR BILL. I'm good now I can die happy
I mean it has to be a pretty spectacular high. But I'm not as bad as I was a few hours ago. Still tired. But better.
There is exactly ONE upside to having bpd: all I need is one high to pull me out of the mess of lows to fix my day. üòä
@mayaducard THE HELL IS THIS. PUT IT BACK.
@mixeduppainter we need people to LIKE them. Because then they accept a small part of us we don't typically show the world.
"@mixeduppainter But books, man... they're my life. We're authors! They're like pieces of your soul you're entrusting to other people."
"@mixeduppainter oh believe me, you can absolutely be TOO passionate about things for people. My whole life I've been ""too much"""
@mixeduppainter too passionate. That's my problem I guess. But thanks for understanding ‚ù§Ô∏è
@mixeduppainter ahhhh I just rambled I'm sorry üò¨
"@mixeduppainter but at first... I dunno, it's just hard to pitch when it's not unique at first glance."
"@mixeduppainter you know? Not anything special. I mean it IS, obviously, there's so much more going on than I reveal in the book"
"@mixeduppainter it's not supposed to be. It's just a story, nothing more, nothing less. And I was afraid and ashamed because it's... not"
@mixeduppainter oh you don't even KNOW. This whole day I was feeling discouraged and cowed because I know my book isn't original.
Not boring or typical or clich√©. Comfort. A classic story so you can escape and not have to think too much. Yes! That's my writing style.
"My God, I'm just deflating in relief right now lol it's not even funny. Comfort reading. That's what my books are. Of course."
"@KateElliottSFF @mixeduppainter Yes! Yes! Yes! That's what my books are! Oh THANK YOU, you put it into words!"
@HutchingsJulie https://t.co/Gj2eisfqwf
"@FromPawnToQueen lol no prob, I'm here for ya üòä"
@FromPawnToQueen I have a Japanese stepmom. I can ask her some questions for you if you want?
"Lucky Freeman, illegal angel-demon hybrid destined to end a war he has no part in. The catch? He has to die to do it. #DVpit #UF #YA #own"
Ugh. Ignore me. I sound like a child.
"Don't give up. I know. I'm not. Just hurts, that's all. I'll get over it. Just... I know where my book is going. I know what it can do."
"I knew what I was getting into when I wrote it, and I'm trying... not to complain, or whatever, but with every rejection I just..."
"It just doesn't seem like it is. It's not supposed to. It's supposed to be simple, ordinary, classic adventure romp. Totally typical."
"I'm... getting discouraged. I'm trying not to be, but I am. And I don't wanna disagree or protest but... my book is GOOD. It is."
"*PLAYING ""TAKE A CHANCE ON ME"" IN THE DISTANCE* https://t.co/IlWGmaMzYf"
@muliebris I'll jump on that bandwagon
"Lucky's a mixed kid of a different kind: an illegal hybrid of angels and demons, destined to die to end their War. #DVpit #YA #UF #ownvoices"
I can't believe I got that in lol. Two minutes to spare! Off to work now!
"16yo Lucky Freeman is a hybrid, an illegal mix of angel and demon. If he's going to stop The War, he's gonna have to die. #DVpit #YA #UF own"
WAIT WHAT #DVPIT IS TOMORROW?? OH GOD OH GOD

"@CinderScoria Also, guess who's going to the congressional level as a delegate?? THIS GIRL"
"That caucus. took. eight hours.

It was the most fun I've had in weeks"
"I got aboooout three hours of interrupted sleep total, and I've got a nine hour work day today! #PRAYFORME #IMGONNADIE"
@BriannaShrum lol thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"@BriannaShrum Nobody I know locally wants to go with me :(

@nanogeekette HAPPY BIRTHDAY LITTLE DARLING ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
@BriannaShrum I am SO PSYCHED like I never really liked the movie before but now?? I need to watch it right now immediately??
@AMulderWrites @sandykidd OH GOD NO LOVE YOURSELF I promise I won't spoil anything too badly when I'm screaming about it lol
@AMulderWrites uhhh be right back!
@AMulderWrites @sandykidd and 5 comes out iiiiin six days! üôÉ
@AMulderWrites @sandykidd Girl you don't KNOW PAIN. You keep thinking you do. And then season 2. And 3. And FOUR.
@AMulderWrites @sandykidd AND NOW YOU UNDERSTAND THE PAIN OF ZOMBIES RUN. Welcome to the fandom. ü§ó
"@AMulderWrites @sandykidd Ahh, THAT episode *waggly eyebrows*"
@BLikesPrivacy Good! Thank God
"@BLikesPrivacy You could probably put it on airplane mode, but that would mean giving up talking to the rest of us. So it's your choice."
"@BLikesPrivacy I know that when I'm distressed like that, music is the easiest and fastest way to calm down/pass the time."
@BLikesPrivacy just gotta hang in there I guess. Do you have music to listen to?
"@BLikesPrivacy then she'll understand how damaging this is for you, and try to fix it"
"@BLikesPrivacy Well, when my therapist is running late (which happens a LOT), she usually does repair work. So if yours is anything like her"
@BLikesPrivacy do you have time to stay if she did?
@BLikesPrivacy oh jeez. I'm sorry honey *hugs*
"@BLikesPrivacy I know I didn't really help matters earlier but I care about you, dork"
@BLikesPrivacy I'm here if you wanna talk
"@BLikesPrivacy *hugs*

And how's you? I guess we're both having rough days"
@CinderScoria but stop picking on him because of his face. I can't even begin to describe how disgusting that is. Jeez.
"@CinderScoria I wasn't vocal about it earlier, but it's coming back and I've had enough. Disapprove of the casting choice, ok, I don't care"
@CinderScoria STOP saying he's ugly and he looks like an alien. JFC that is INCREDIBLY damaging and I can't believe it's still a thing.
"Look, it's fine if you don't like Benedict Cumberbatch or disapprove of the casting choice, but STOP calling him an alien."
Really wanna spend today in a coffeeshop writing. Just... forgetting about everything. It's been a rough couple of months.
@singingpurple20 MISS YOU TOOOOO ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Happy #NationalSiblingsDay feat one of my six! @7calebbrown22 https://t.co/DMuZqdmgAP

@Ch1Con @TheERRose I guess we teach each other lol
"@Ch1Con @TheERRose Ah, but if you knew the kids in my group... They kick my ass in prose and plots. I feel simple next to them."
"A5: Oh, and angst! That's what my reviewers on fanfiction and Ao3 tell me lol. And cliffhangers. I used to be queen for that. #Ch1Con"
I just voted for an early #CaptainAmericaCivilWar screening in my city! #TeamCapScreening https://t.co/XbuwsoO6jy
A5: I'm good with characters and relationships. And I guess also world building. My friend calls me Tolkien. (Emily what?? üíïüíï) #Ch1con
"A5: I've been told, though, that my strong point is dialogue and flow. So I hope that's what I can rub off on my author friends. #Ch1Con"
"A5: Well I'm the eldest out of my kids. They tend to look up to me (I don't know WHY, they're all brilliant writers and I'm proud.) #Ch1Con"
@AMulderWrites A+++ gif usage üëåüèæüëåüèæüëåüèæ
"A4: Catch-22 references ALL OVER THE PLACE. My kids, God bless. #Ch1Con"
"A4: And with the kids, definitely, we get side tracked a LOT. Like we have our moments of professionalism. Then Victor Hugo... #Ch1Con"
@AMulderWrites SEVEN BILLION PEOPLE ON THE PLANET AND I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO MEET YOU
A4: Of COURSE. Twitter's good about that lol. I had a really tight knit group from the Nanowrimo site. And of course my kids! #Ch1Con
@AMulderWrites I GOT NOTHIN THEN. I did know you before I knew Brett though. I just have no idea how or where lol
@AMulderWrites ... Maybe? That sounds familiar hold on... Was I jsyk there?? Is that the one?
"A3: It's like having your work analyzed when you're a professional, paid, polished, bona fide author. Like you're important. Smart. #Ch1Con"
"A3: And finding people who will catch all the little things you put in, because they're authors too, is the BEST. #Ch1Con"
"A3: Authors have no shame. They can be like ""so how many different ways can staplers kill a person?"" And it's totally chill. #Ch1Con"
"A2: Twitter! Love Twitter. And, like, fanfiction. Online groups tbh?? The Nanowrimo site too! #Ch1Con"
@halogalopagos @BookSquirt FIIIIIISH
"@halogalopagos @BookSquirt As a matter of fact, I am a LEO and therefore FIREPROOF"
@AMulderWrites ???? I HAVE NO IDEA. HAVE WE KNOWN EACH OTHER FROM A PAST LIFE?? Are you a PFer??
"#Ch1Con A1: I call em my kids lol. They're all younger than me, and brilliant too. We have regular meetups for poetry, check in, and coffee!"
"#Ch1Con A1: Twitter tends to be where I hit up other writers, but I have stayed in touch with three of my Young Authors Group from 6th grade"
"Oh gosh, I've got some catching up to do lol. First things first: hiya! I'm Jasmine and I like warm hugs! (... I'm sorry. Oh god.) #Ch1Con"
#ch1con *CRASHLANDS INTO THREAD* I'M HERE WHAT HAPPENED IS IT OVER AM I LATE???
... where are they?
@mayaducard thank you though ‚ù§Ô∏è
"@mayaducard yeah, no, I'm just kind of exhausted and overwhelmed?? I have a lot of obligations and some I just can't meet, and that sucks."
"... yep, I'm about to start crying in a second. Okay. I'm gone."
"@SisAngel ... Damn, even I can't be mad at a pun like that"
"Whoo boy. Didn't mean to rant, sorry. I've had a hell of a week."
"That's harsh. But God, when I'm half off my feet exhausted every day and he's accusing me of ignoring him on purpose, I'm gonna LOSE IT."
"Plus Dad and I haven't really been on good terms lately... Honestly though, there is so much I'm going through rn, he's just not a priority."
Trying to stay awake so I can see Dad and his side of the family before I pass out but they ain't home and I gotta be up early tomorrow sooo
"Whoa. Having two jobs is exhausting, and I'm still in training for BOTH. But I just got home and sat down and suddenly I need Life Alert üò™üí§"
@SisAngel I'm not liking any of these tweets. I refuse.
@SisAngel *MUFFLED SCREAMING IN THE DISTANCE*
@SisAngel I NO LONGER HAVE A PS. ANGEL IS DEAD AND GONE. (At least for the next five hours.)
@SisAngel you're dead to me.
How does the rain always come back when I'm upset? It soothes instantly. It's like it knows.
Okay I tried but I'm about to do that thing where I just kinda flop onto my bed and pass out for like five hours if that's cool with you
That was fun! I actually love politics?? #iCaucused üëåüèæ
@ElleOnWords wait what?? Omg I completely forgot!

@ElleOnWords Confession time: I shipped Jason and Trini. But that's because I discovered fanfiction around the same time and I was biased :P
@ElleOnWords Real talk: Kimberly was straight up badass. Her actress went on to be Jules in Flashpoint (EXCELLENT SHOW watch it)
@ElleOnWords always. I cried when I heard she died. :(
"@ElleOnWords I REMEMBER THE VOICES. I REMEMBER TRINI'S ""SABERTOOTH TIGER"" WAS MY FAVORITE"

@ElleOnWords @netflix OH GOD yes. I stand by my claim that Dino Thunder has the funniest dialogue. Dr. O lost all fucks back during Zeo
"@ElleOnWords @netflix okay but whatever you do, get to Time Force and RPM. Like, RPM's a bit newer (and my fav ha) but Time Force definitely"
