@lori195776 @ThankYouBernie cmon obviously cenk is on our side. There's nothing to this critique
@MSNBC @SenWarren would not accept a position w the woman who went back on her bankruptcy vote. We forget she was big HRC critic #keepitreal
@ThankYouBernie I don't think cenk is anti Bernie or bust to the extent that progressives attack their own.
"@ShaunKing @BernieSanders he was right, Greenspan didn't realize regular ppl weren't seeing these higher standards of living."
@jiadarola @tmtodaro Vox has been pretty fcking off when it comes to tax calculations i.e. Calculator
@TheSunNews @BernieSanders compared to HRC misspeaks this is nothing.
Why Is Joe Biden Talking About...putting Biden in over Bernie would make hand trump the election. #angryindie  https://t.co/lSXgIYlzSq

@FiveThirtyEight within the framework of it not hurting Hillary. What if he wins? Still possible.
@NateSilver538 @FiveThirtyEight I'm concerned with ur poll weighting methodology. What makes surveyUSA CA poll value higher than sextant?
"Exclusive: Trump surges in support, almost even with Clinton - he could beat her 60/40 in pop vote @TYTNetwork #wows https://t.co/NsrALkF3i9"
@cenkuygur Nate silver seems to be improperly weighing polls in Hillarys favor. See sextant v surveyUSA poll on @FiveThirtyEight CA primary
"@NateSilver538 what all factors went into weighting sextant CA  poll more than surveyUSA poll. Former is more recent, more polled &amp; RV"
@drvox you just can't stand him using his large platform to speak ill of your fav candidate. Congrats on ur bias.
@davidsirota there really should be more rules governing what @POTUS can say about elections. He's basically endorsed Hillary 3 times.
"thank christ, could've come a little sooner @BarackObama fuck https://t.co/dmYl3l8GNc"
"Don't trust @NateSilver538 @FiveThirtyEight for polling projections, they are improperly and misleadingly weighting polls as they see fit"
"@Wikipedia @Bernie_Facts @TYTNetwork WIKIPEDIA U NEED TO REMOVE NEBRASKA SYMBOLIC PRIMARY, this is not an extra win for @HillaryClinton"
@Wikipedia @Bernie_Facts @TYTNetwork https://t.co/8bi0HiLY3Z
"@Wikipedia is ACTUALLY SHOWING Nebreska's symbolic primary as a WIN FOR HILLARY! Bullshit, doesn't count, no dels @Bernie_Facts @TYTNetwork"
@FiveThirtyEight @NateSilver538 @BernieSanders polls-plus forecast should be higher if you properly weighted every poll @Bernie_Facts
@FiveThirtyEight @TYTNetwork problem with @NateSilver538 bias is behind the numbers &amp; nobody questions method @Thom_Hartmann @Bernie_Facts
"@FiveThirtyEight larger, more recent RV poll from sextant weighted at .62 vs less recent smaller LV poll is weighted at 1.5, misleading"
@FiveThirtyEight weights smaller LV less accurate polls with large Hillary lead more than larger more recent polls https://t.co/U2HbC73QxQ

let's have a conversation about corrupt Affirmative Action &amp; the need for reparations for the black community https://t.co/BtJum46mkj
@thejackalspeaks by assigning equal quota value 2 all minorities u end up underrepresenting black community in many ways we need reparations
@thejackalspeaks It actually allow 4 continued institutional racism and the lumping of all POC does disservice to black community...2/3
We need to ditch Affirmative Action which only works against it's own goal of being blind to ethnicity...1/3

@MichaelCeraso @bayarea_bias beautiful
@cenkuygur they didn't account for surge in @realDonaldTrump support w the advent of his being nominee. New voters 4 GOP. #scary #unity üò±
@thejackalspeaks and trump has already proven that he will likely do the same.

@BayArea4Bernie @paladinette lol. Nader DID take votes but everyone knows GOP used scotus to take that election.
Do we want the candidate w policies that are stronger 4 a recession who can win w enough margin 2 have huge mandate? https://t.co/KIB2nqFOtu
They'll do anything to get u to think he isn't the more progressive candidate. He has transcended party politics  https://t.co/3NZJKPM1oU
@morningmoneyben @libbybakalar @JesseLaGreca we've still got a great candidate left as a viable option. @BernieSanders
