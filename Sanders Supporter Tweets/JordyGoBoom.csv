This kid just fucking dabbed as we drove by. Fucking tool.
@morgdoporto it's all good plenty more of those to come 👌
@morgdoporto I thought we had a good time 🖕
These morning shifts will be the death of me.
I always wondered how @jonbellion sister reacted to Dead Man Walking. 🤔🤔
I feel bad for my friends some days. I'm such a dick. Love you guys.

"""I actually eat tacos 6 times a week.""  I've never wanted to aspire to anything else in my life 😂😂🌮"
@dimmadre we totally need to do this! https://t.co/CItA5iJytZ
Fucking tell me about it. https://t.co/AdwmfZ3Jl2
I havent felt this low in a minute.
This is literally the hardest thing I've had to watch.
I get a sick fucking pleasure out of watching you actually fucking take care of your wife. That's a fucking first.
I literally fucked everything.. What else is fucking new.
And I'm not sure what I've done.
I can't do this. All it too was a taste and I'm lost. Im gonna lose it. I can't resist.
I can never watch this movie too much. https://t.co/alQpGXas40
Option C that you don't even consider is the option that will love you. If you focus too much on one thing you lose everything around it.
Quit focusing on Option A that just plays you or Option B that uses you.
@kenzi_coral @V2Presents I know. I thought about it.
On that note if anyone is down or needs to talk I got you. I listen because the world needs more listeners and less dictators. And I'm out.
"Those may be the people who would give everything to make your day, or just want a chance to talk to you. Love the little things."
This world is so cruel. Love those who take the time to ask how your day was or just those who say hello even if they don't know you well.
You guys just do you. Sit on the couch covered in food watching some dumb movie and laughing about. Do what makes you two happy together.
If he/she can't love you at your worst they sure as fuck don't deserve you at your best.
Be happy with who you have. And if you don't have someone find someone who loves you and not how you look.
All that matters is that you are happy with someone Anyone trying to take that away or downplay it is jealous of the love you share. Fuck em
Who gives a shit what people think of them. Do they make you laugh? Do they make you feel special? Do you guys do gross cute things?
Quit spending all this time looking for a supermodel on the outside when there are so many people who are supermodels on the inside.
"Fall for someone who is a beautiful person. Looks fade. Fall in love with someone eyes, or a smile. Something that will always exist."
@QuanticoTV just fucked me up. Holy shit.

You're a piece of shit for what you did. What you've done. She deserves so much fucking better than you. Fuck you and burn in hell. 🖕
These next few months are going to ruin me emotionally.
"I want a perfect little family, in my house by the woods, with a porch I can sit and watch the rain come down on. That's it."
"Can I just say I need this rainy, Thunder, lightning, cloud gloom and doom in my life everyday? Moving to Washington. Bye."
I just saw the cutest family. I need that.
@dimmadre I know right.
If you're buying Potters to get drunk go to rehab. Jesus no one should treat their liver that way
@kenzi_coral Fine! :P Brownies or cookies either work.
@kenzi_coral Why not?
@kenzi_coral Nah. Surprise me. 👌

I can't sleep. This is gonna be a big week for me. I'm getting my life back on track.
I understand why Cameron and House couldn't be together but it doesn't make me want what they had any less.  😞Hurts me inside. 😢😢
"""I'm sorry I won't do it again.""
""Yes, you will!""
""All the more reason this debate is pointless.""

I vent on different social medias for different reasons. The reasons are no one's business. I need outlets so I can survive.
Don't set a precedent for the relationship and then get mad when that precedent is used against you. It can't be both ways.
You treat them badly enough long enough and they're gonna push back or leave your sorry ass. You'll have no one to blame but yourself.
Don't be shitty to people who you know care about you. They're gonna be there through it all. Unless you keep treating them like shit.
