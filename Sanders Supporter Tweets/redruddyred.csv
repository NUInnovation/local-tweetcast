@brianvastag the organizers of #millionsmissing (who don't have twitter) have asked  if u are coming to protest? what do i tell them?
@KimmeeKMiller only the chronic illness crowd here
@batteredoldbook be well james
@batteredoldbook i'm sorry but i'm not following you. are you denying the dunningkruger effect?
"@batteredoldbook ""it"": many good and very sick ppl who are not involved with ""it"". your purist inclinations wildly antipragmatic."
"@batteredoldbook i'm thinking more of the followers, not the ringleaders. they know what they're doing."
@batteredoldbook @beaker1986 sure but not everyone has your moral clarity &amp; courage to speak.
@nee_massey @MichelleAkers10 @cher @FleaChili @StevieNicks @RandyNewman @MamaChill @johnmrutter @LeighHatcher @CrawfordMichael
@JohnnySoftware have some more nancy reagan with that
@JohnnySoftware sorry but you're getting annoying and this conversation isn't going anywhere. thanks for the insights. bye.
@JohnnySoftware only if they have an underlying psychological disorder
@JohnnySoftware okay believe that if it makes you feel better about yourself.
"@JohnnySoftware no there aren't.
i'm disabled and people don't give a shit
you're delusional"
@JohnnySoftware okay i think you should tell them that
@JohnnySoftware because gay = crazy? watch ur own bigotry tho.
@JohnnySoftware apparently it is according to jesse.
"@JohnnySoftware okay i know, but the law needs to be written explicitly to exclude cis men. my understanding is it wasn't."
"@JohnnySoftware oppression means you fight back against specific roots of oppression, not give privileges over others."
@JohnnySoftware the problem with the bathrooms is that some feel it impedes on them. so need to reassure. not me. them.
"@JohnnySoftware okay, but that's not what i was addressing.
thanks for the rant tho."
"@JohnnySoftware not sure on that one, i think most ppl are disgusted &amp; outraged by these stories."
@JohnnySoftware cops = killers.  ask any blm activist.  a few good ones but mostly bullies and sadists.
@JohnnySoftware it's not because ppl hate disabled: they're just easy targets. trans the same. hatred not enough excuse to kill.
"@JohnnySoftware okay but these are people who kill
easier to kill someone who has weaker ties 2 society
disabled victimized @ higher r8 2"
@JohnnySoftware i'm sorry but this is just a poor line of argument. and doesn't address the law. which i disagree with btw.
"@JohnnySoftware cis men prey on women out of bigotry, should they... have their own bathrooms?"
@JohnnySoftware okay but just because was trans doesn't prove intent. it's like cops go after poors and blacks because easy prey.
"@JohnnySoftware again, i think you're confusing ppl who murder with rest of society."
@JohnnySoftware yes but this doesn't explain why people support it. maybe you should be talking to them.
@JohnnySoftware i doubt it. i don't think there's the stigma against trans you think there is. against spying on someone pee yes.
"@JohnnySoftware okay but it's still illegal for them to do so, for whatever reason"
@JohnnySoftware it's still illegal surveillance tho. i don't understand why we are arguing? i agree trans deserve correct bathrooms.
"@JohnnySoftware as i was saying, that's illegal.  the guy lost his job and was publicly shamed."
@JohnnySoftware sorry but that's incoherent. try again?
@JohnnySoftware you wanna show me the proof. because i'm p sure that's illegal.
@JohnnySoftware last i checked that's not a bathroom
@JohnnySoftware i thought jessie was being pretty dumb and nonempathetic: tumblr sjw troll
@JohnnySoftware this is true but doesn't address why some ppl might have problem with law.
@JohnnySoftware that's not the premise of disgrmnt tho; the problem is trans isn't legally defined and needs to be. need 2 write better law.
ALEC seems to find it useful to lobby at state legislatures. how can #pwme make use of this tactic? @MEActNet
@batteredoldbook @beaker1986 it's my opinion that a lot of patients in a place of low self-confidence and yelling not useful.
@JohnnySoftware the bathroom thing is a totally stupid point of conflict as no one is checking anyone's genitals - I THINK
@JohnnySoftware i agree it's stupid but need to reach out to the heteronormative masses to reassure. not yell names on twitter.
@batteredoldbook @beaker1986 i'll agree with that.  i think there are easier ways to build consensus tho.
@beaker1986 @batteredoldbook to me ignoring the coyne problem smacks of moral cowardice: conflict is hard for #pwme but frequently healthy.
@beaker1986 @batteredoldbook haven't been keeping my finger on the pulse so much but thanks for sharing your insight.  it helps.
@SlightlyAlive94 @Katiissick thank the very talented and generous wendy boutillier! https://t.co/CHZ7MMV1mD
"@JohnnySoftware ""ppl who shoot ppl"" =/ ""ppl who vote""
yelling at twitterers uncomfortable with new law is not the way forward"
@JohnnySoftware no i'm saying bullies pick on those who appear to be different as won't have social network to protect.
"@JohnnySoftware seems like there is not a legal def of trans besides ""the gender you feel you are inside"" and this scares some ppl"
"@JohnnySoftware i think the crux of the issue is to reassure voters who are caught up in the ""cis guys in the women's locker room!"" argument"
@JohnnySoftware would you mind elucidating? btw i am pro trans ppl using the bathroom they identify as
@JohnnySoftware my issue with trans community is they want the oppression trump card. lots of oppression in world. a bit narcissistic.
@JohnnySoftware i think there is still discomfort with trans; this is not at the crux of the bathroom red herring -- which is stupid btw.
@batteredoldbook @beaker1986 that said i think you have been more than you know. too soon to give up. take care of self &amp; come back.
@ssppeerroo @batteredoldbook yeah i don't get it either
@batteredoldbook @beaker1986 i'm merely trying to point you in direction where you can be more effective.
@JohnnySoftware lots of ppl being killed by cops anymore. correlation not causation
@batteredoldbook @beaker1986 what was your purpose in confronting them? shame? what did u expect?
"@batteredoldbook i protest injustice as a hobby and you'd be shocked at how pissed ppl are just by our presence, disrupting their day."
@batteredoldbook @beaker1986 this behavior is typical of most professional environments tho
@batteredoldbook @beaker1986 did you get a response tho
"@batteredoldbook as a nonacademic you couldn't possibly understand the subtle, brilliant thoughts that flit thru coyne's mind #ProtectUrOwn"
@batteredoldbook @beaker1986 yeah but the difference is they should know better than to inflict on others. power gradient doesn't apply.
@batteredoldbook a good metaphor is that joke abt a physicist who wants to measure vol of cow and pretends cow is perfect sphere.
@batteredoldbook you could say it's elegant because it makes ME disappear!
@batteredoldbook with a discrete (not infinite) number of variables. ie not the human body.
"@batteredoldbook seems to me like framing the problem in a way that can be easily solved.
this is done w/i systems of logic with a discrete"
@batteredoldbook @beaker1986 honestly i think they agree with his sentiment tho won't put it so bluntly
@batteredoldbook @beaker1986 maybe more upset that coyne was an idiot than that ppl were hurt
@batteredoldbook @beaker1986 which david?
"@batteredoldbook if i had to be so general i'd say ""idealists and openhearted optimistics"" vs ""worldweary pragmatists and machiavellians"""
"@batteredoldbook interesting, but this is not the way i would draw the line"
"@beaker1986 @batteredoldbook ""head in the sand"" phenomenon is rife. coyne's behavior hurts us on many levels."
@batteredoldbook @beaker1986 i think patients do truly have common ground on this issue
"@batteredoldbook @beaker1986 ""can claim""
let's face it, it's all abt the money
in some cases, the egos, and sense of superiority"
@beaker1986 @batteredoldbook i think your autocomplete function is obscuring ur meaning
@beaker1986 @batteredoldbook the twitter algorithm is way ahead of me :)
@beaker1986 @batteredoldbook yeah tom i think he silently agrees with us although lack of courage on this issue not admirable.
"@beaker1986 @batteredoldbook MEaction maybe a viable cure. unfortunately PR makes efforts to pander to med establishment, patients last."
"@beaker1986 @batteredoldbook unless someone wants to hack the shit out of PR or software engineer replacement, don't see change coming"
"@batteredoldbook i feel like this is continuation of your ""projection of fault onto others"" thought"
"@beaker1986 @batteredoldbook we defos get locked into internet feuds too easily.
lots of smart pragmatic folk. MEadv, despite the propaganda"
@batteredoldbook @beaker1986 i think if you approach him nonconfrontationally he might agree with you that coyne's behavior was poor.
@batteredoldbook @beaker1986 tom's a nice guy but very smart and deserves to have more of a career than making facebook memes.
@batteredoldbook @beaker1986 i don't think you'll get much travel from that: coyne was promoting tom's work or something
"@beaker1986 @batteredoldbook haha, i thought that was my faction (so they say)
i've always sensed that the other team's goal was control"
"@batteredoldbook @FibroMEcfs i'll agree they frequently act as their surrogates
lots of poorly written sci articles being pushed around"
@batteredoldbook @beaker1986 maybe best to realize &amp; accept vulnerability in community and focus on maintaining one's inner peace.
@batteredoldbook i'll have to try to wrap my head around that one.
@beaker1986 @batteredoldbook yeah but you do not see support for him anywhere else.  sad.
@FibroMEcfs @batteredoldbook discovering true knowledge requires humility and ability to learn from others. pwme should know most of all.
@FibroMEcfs @batteredoldbook the trouble is that they're not so smart
@beaker1986 @batteredoldbook i agree that he is mostly ignored anymore and i do not see any RTs from pwme who used to do so assiduously
@batteredoldbook let me know if you have any insights
"@batteredoldbook are you serious??
i can't think of anything i care less abt than SEID."
@JesseBenn this is why datalounge hates you
"@batteredoldbook yeah but that's all noise.
i had a nice conversation with someone on the other side under wrong impression that hated her."
@batteredoldbook i'm one of them i guess to me it looks like an unprofessional mess
@JesseBenn this is not how you convince ppl to support laws for equality. lgbt community split on this issue. not a good sign.
@JesseBenn so do lots of group. you need a better line of argument.
"@JesseBenn it doesn't reflect will of the ppl except for unenforceable ""bathroom"" red herring.
i'd love to see the memes."
@batteredoldbook the science stuff is quite good and thorough there btw it's when they get to advocacy they flub up.
@batteredoldbook i think they have a v narrow range of what constitutes acceptable opinion.
"@batteredoldbook me too, but solidarity isn't cool anymore"
"@batteredoldbook we see the same thing in politics: ppl are easily swayed by red herrings, appeals to authority. not thinking abt it so much"
@batteredoldbook i think the thing to remember is that despite the obvious assholes there are those who can be persuaded to our side
"@batteredoldbook it's sad, but typical that will support abuse of other patients for their own advancement."
"@batteredoldbook it's the phoenix rising crowd, they run a v oppressive environment there against those who would speak out."
"@batteredoldbook the trouble is it's never abt science, and always abt politics. i think if we argue on sci basis we will lose."
"@batteredoldbook shouldn't be, anyone scientifically literate can point out the glaring flaws in these studies. tuller not scientist but np."
@batteredoldbook friend at MEadv thinks that ppl are afraid that no one will help them if not coyne. he has marketed himself so.
@batteredoldbook in any conflict there is an opportunity to step back and look for the root. in my case: jealousy because had recovered.
"@batteredoldbook i mean cmon guy has a record for domestic violence and goes around calling ppl ""assaultive assholes""?  LOL"
"@batteredoldbook his aggression is purposeful and with purpose: to subdue you, to win, to have his way."
@batteredoldbook are we talking abt coyne? he is simply a bully. should he bother you again am pleased to clean his clock.
@batteredoldbook and we see more and more that psychopathic attributes are key to success (and Success Is Best)
"@batteredoldbook unwilling i should think. ppl leaving religion for all the right reasons, but throwing baby out with bathwater."
@batteredoldbook my guess is looking back that they let their suffering corrupt their soul: turned their misery against others.
@batteredoldbook it's always been an ugly scene. there's a rather nasty group at PR who outright bullied me when i spoke of my experiences.
@batteredoldbook is this abt coyne? PACE? i understand there are UK charities not taking stance against the trial.
@batteredoldbook i wonder if we are not talking at crosspurposes and i have somehow grossly misunderstood you
"@batteredoldbook my experience is that it tends to make ppl more sensitive and vulnerable, therefore ""tread carefully"""
@batteredoldbook i think the problems with society are best explained by adoption of a just world hypothesis
@batteredoldbook the coyne thing because unfortunately political and i am v disappointed in those who continued to support him
@batteredoldbook my experience is that most patients are v nice ppl and consensus can be reached in 95% of cases
@ohsorryeh @JesseBenn no one is persecuting you. no one cares. we are all too wrapped up in our own personal lives.
"@JesseBenn everytime someone has a problem with the trans agenda
""BBUT TRANS PPL ARE PERSECUTED!! THE MOST PERSECUTED IN HISTORY OF WORLD!"""
"@JesseBenn re:""nobody cares""
no one wants to kill trans people
we don't care
a few bullies here and there, but typical repsonse is apathy"

@MEActNet can we stop building barriers for discussion between pwme?  the fractured nature of fb and twitter is doing this well enough.
@stepville any chance for another piece in a major publication stephanie? you know we need it?
