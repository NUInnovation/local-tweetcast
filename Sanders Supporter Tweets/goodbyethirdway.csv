@trekkerteach12 Cagey move. We can discount what Trump says just as easily as what HRC says. Just thought it was interesting.

@DemFromCT @ggreenwald Chance at what? Scurry back to your party-purity propaganda hole.
@DemFromCT @ggreenwald I am nice. But now you can run away and cry abuse.
"@DemFromCT @ggreenwald I got that, dipshit. It's just fucked up that you stand for a political party and not for a set of principles."
@DemFromCT @ggreenwald Just Ds? Not leftists? A color and a letter is more important than left-wing ideals?

@AGreenAutumn Scary.
"""We're rebuilding other countries while weakening our own."" - Trump"
"""We have attempted to create democracies in countries that never wanted to move in that direction at the cost of American lives."" - Trump"
Trump is giving a legitimate anti-interventionist foreign policy speech right now. I'm kind of taken aback.
@LarryWebsite Same. I got unending joy from this guy's discovery.
@DemFromCT @ggreenwald So has Trump. Your point?
Obama also invoked the Espionage Act to silence whistleblowers. Super progressive.
"Stepping up the drone war and deporting more people than any president in history does not a progressive make. Sorry, Barry."
"Calling Obama a progressive is adorable and sounds reasonable to olds, but no one under the age of 30 sees him that way, for good reason."
Does anyone want to tell HRC that only one of those two dudes can stake a legit claim to the progressive label? https://t.co/oVBKrwATpS
