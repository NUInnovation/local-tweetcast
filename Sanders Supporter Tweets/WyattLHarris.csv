@Natasha5560 fucking preach
When you're the only one not old enough to go in a dispensary so you hang out at a gas station alone. üò≠üòÖ
@Cortlan_ @Natasha5560 @madeladams that's why she's my friend
Walking across campus during student government elections is actually the worst thing ever. Leave me alone please.
My teacher came through and didn't include the section that I have no idea how to do on the exam. Props to you Cindy. You my girl.
I love getting marked off on a quiz for doing too much work. College man. College.
I just want to live in a world where people don't put heart eye emojis next to pictures of athletic shoes being worn in every day garb.
About to send my rent check for next month and my land lord still hasn't even deposited my check for April. üòë
I can't wait to graduate so I can have time off to go to Coachella. I'm coming for you baby. @Natasha5560 better join.
@TheHoodVines @FightCIubs @Cortlan_
May can't come any faster. End of the school year and I get to go to disclosure again. So excited!
"I keep finding myself saying shit like ""I think I have enough time for a nap tomorrow, I'm really excited."" My life is very sad."
Sitting in my car singing The Music Of The Night from Phantom of the Opera and realized I was crying. What the fuck?
Made the brave choice to not wash or dry shamp my hair today. Never felt more nasty in my life and that's really saying something.
@BossAssHumor @Natasha5560
@Cortlan_ @BabyAnimalPics üò≠üò≠üò≠ oh my god
Lol @jeliohernandez https://t.co/37j8k8AWxt
@Cortlan_ this is too real üòÇüëåüèªüíØ
@Rokstarr75 holla at your boy
I just have a really hard time being nice to you if you post annoying shit arguing about Chevy vs Ford. Execute yourselves folks.
Every time I go into the freshman dorms I get flashbacks to the worst year of my life. Fuck all of that.
Drunk me has this rude habit of turning off my wifi and ruining my life.
There's never been a problem that dry shampoo couldn't fix.
Don't talk about my aglet like he isn't here right now.
Straight boys love their ugly plaid shorts so much they don't even let negative temperatures and snow stop them from wearing them.
@madiriotgirl I can't handle him today.
My deal breaker is if a man has bad shoes. It's a real concern.
@kenshero13 don't
@kenshero13 our lives with each other  https://t.co/TAQmp8fjWY
The biggest asshole move is to make plans and not even have the decency to cancel or let you know if you can't follow through. üëåüèª
@Cortlan_ and @kenshero13 took my purse so they could sneak food into the movie theatre. #Imaproperwoman
I get off work at ten tonight. I don't think Walmart understands that's my bed time every night.
@Cortlan_ preach
@jeliohernandez must really not care since you spelled his name wrong. üò¨
Works sucks. Take me back to @HARDWELL https://t.co/ezhXrWDyTm
Next time I'll be braver. I'll be my own savior.
I fixed my car today. And actually crying tears of joy because I did something right for once.
Nobody in the crowd understood my love for @MatthewKoma. It was fucking beautiful.
My biggest regret is not fighting people to get to @MatthewKoma when he came to the audience tonight.
So excited for round two of decadence tonight. However the thought of showering and getting dressed is too damn much.
For fucking real https://t.co/6EsSqU5GZp
@madiriotgirl @jeliohernandez üòÇüòÇüò©üò©üò≠üò≠
@jeliohernandez @madiriotgirl oh she's got jokes I see.
@madiriotgirl @jeliohernandez I don't even want to play with y'all at decadence tomorrow anymore haha
@madiriotgirl @jeliohernandez MADI NO
@madiriotgirl YOU'RE A SPECIAL KIND OF EVIL
@jeliohernandez they are when they're attached to your bitch ass.
@jeliohernandez I didn't think you wanted me to respond to that haha
@jeliohernandez makes small children swear to intimidate me. What a guy!
@Natasha5560 a hoe never gets cold
No boss I'm sorry I can't stay late. Pikachu was fighting Magmar in a volcano and I really need to see what happens. Hope you understand.
"Decided to go grocery shopping after work. Ended up just getting assorted cheeses, breads and butters. All I really need in life."
"I'm sick, tired and stressed out over school. But it's all alright because my parka is going to be here today. üòçüôÉ"
@Homoposts @Cortlan_ @jeliohernandez
@madiriotgirl it's so sad how much I relate to this
@TheWeirdVines @Crm720
#actualrelationshipgoals https://t.co/h2m4txRcqU
"And the ""I didn't do a damn thing for school over break"" panic begins. üòÖ"
Hopelessly devoted to you.
@SouthernHomo @Crm720
There isn't a damn person on campus and here I am still not having decent wifi. üòë
"You know it's been a long week when you get home, fall asleep in all your clothes including your coat and wake up 14 hours later."
Every single time I check my tracking on my package it has been pushed back another day. Maybe I should stop looking. Thanks @FedEx
I wonder if people that see me walking across campus know I'm  listening to Hannah Montana. #guiltypleasure
"@Cortlan_ farts really loud against the hardwood floor.
""I had to move my thong for that one so you guys could hear it."""
I love sitting in my room hearing @Cortlan_'s laughs bc she's doing something weird as fuck to the cat or dog.
"The only reason @jeliohernandez watches American Horror Story with me is bc he wants to make fun of my queen, Lady Gaga to me. Little bitch."
"My Marketing teacher who hates pop music trying to compliment Maroon 5.
""....Adam Levine, he's very... Chiseled."""
Leave for Denver in a bit and I haven't a thing to wear. MUST go shopping soon.
@Natasha5560 found me in a giant crowd from decadence last year. https://t.co/QQiQisH4RG
"I wanted to watch an episode on Netflix before work, then I remembered I'm gross and haven't showered in days. Fuuuuu"
Nobody at work will sing Wildest Dreams with me when it comes on the radio. I WANT TO QUIT NOW
@jeliohernandez  https://t.co/T5n4S9jE3c
"I know when that hotline bling, that can only mean one thing. @DrakeNYC http://t.co/a5oQoiVSlp"
"Didn't go to class Wednesday, woke up early to find out today's class is online and I can sleep for an extra hour. PRAISE"
I low key hate my days off I need to be doing something.
"""I don't want Netflix and Chill. I want IMAX and Climax."""
Having the boyfriends Google Play account info might be the best thing that's ever happened to me.
@jeliohernandez @Homoposts üòÇüòÇüò∑üò∑üòÇüòÇ I'm dying
"It's sad to think I could have gotten a 95% on my exam if I hadn't messed up most of the True or False questions. It was 50, 50. WTF"
What a shitty fucking day.
"It's great to be in a great place again, the only problem with being happy and smiling constantly is people asking you why."
@_CollegeHumor_ @madiriotgirl only so much worse
@Cortlan_ @kenshero13 y'all are savage
@bailey_crompton I'm dying. üòÇüëåüèªüëåüèª
Winehouse and Chill is not something to be taken lightly apparently.
Thank the good lord  https://t.co/sBaUWq8JZ8
Favorite part about being in the College of Business is that they have chargers on every desk. Never have to actually be prepared.
Seriously all I look forward to lately is going home and cuddling my dog and existing near my best friends.
@jeliohernandez we get it you don't like vaginas
My teacher just said she doesn't like pasta. I'm about ready to stand up and walk out her damn class. Who the fuck.
So far over nights are not my cup of tea. STRAIGHT snoozing in class rn.
"When a guy you dated posts on Facebook and literally claims he is ""completely, irrevocably, undyingly heterosexual."" üòÇüòÇüòÇ WTF HAPPENED"
@jeliohernandez üòÇüòÇ
@jeliohernandez most bad ass episode.
How we dry Dookie after his bath. http://t.co/bKBEGjkd41
College is about lending your house to your friends to either get laid or to take hella nudes.
@WyattLHarris like he did this himself http://t.co/mGPKTQQhuh
My dog is so strange. He insists on sleeping under the covers with you.
All I've been waiting for all day is to go home and do school work while watching the Kardashians.
Kim gets it. #AllBlackEverything  https://t.co/Jwdsi1zek5
@Natasha5560 @GlobalDanceFest yaaaaaaas!!!
Painting my ceiling is actually the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
When both your Friday classes are canceled and you don't have to work.üòÑ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòç
@Cortlan_ and I are four feet from each other and we send photos and tag each other in things to not have to move our arms to show our phone
Left Laramie at 5:30am. Got to Evanston at 10am. Leave for Bear Lake at 10:30am. Love my life with @kenshero13 and @Cortlan_
In a few minutes I'll be turning 20 at Walmart. #turnup
