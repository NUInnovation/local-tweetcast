No HRC you are not my friend no matter how many emails address me as such.  I'm still #BernieOrBust. He's not alone. #NotMeUs #Power2Peeps
@amaIndawallwin I'm a deep south progressive. These are facts. I don't find facts condescending.
@scrapesta You wish Bernie was misogynistic. But keep digging for dirt. It's what #Hillary does best when she starts to lose. Again.
@scrapesta An an American Indian woman dipshit. Go Bernie Bro someone else. You need a new comeback tho.
"If you're complaining about #DemocraticWhores comment, chances are you are one. It's a gender neutral term. HRC is def one. #NeverHillary"

@CoryBooker I love my@POTUS. I'm gonna love the old jewish guy just as well as my POTUS. But I'll miss Obama's substance &amp; style.
@LeeBorowska @GenMthinker The #Hillbullies know this. They just think we don't. Makes me happy they're already grasping at straws lol.
Cover Art mock-up.  Very exciting. https://t.co/fA2OfBsUH2
"@bilo231 @ObtusePollman @JesseFFerguson Yeah, like good leaders do. The right side of history is a possible place to be, not unrealistic"
@SDzzz @aggsveprogressv Poor posturing. HRC says she hates greedy Wall St. corporations 2. What's the matter? U don't believe her either?
@wolfiemouse @GerrishLisa @finneyk HRC always pro-choice.Unlike #Bernie HRC said govt. regulation is OK 4 late term abortion in some cases.
"@shanyesforall  #Hillary is an elitist interventionist. She conspires to topple governments for ""business opportunities. #HillNo"
#Clinton will never apologize @SenSanders. Not her style. Lawyers never admit guilt lol. She's already shrill. It's why I'm #BernieorBust
"In a civilized country, healthcare is a right, not a privilege. #TalkBernie2Me"
@MrSamuelColt @ExtinctElephant @BernieSanders That's OUR guy. He has great empathy as all great leaders do.Stay positive. #TalkBernie2Me

"Remember all the things #Shillary did to PBO in 08, race baiting, calling him a Muslim (as an insult). Nothing is beneath her #NeverHillary"
Jeezus Mr. Belafonte looks fandangtabulous !! You and Spike look great too!  #BernieorBust #FeelTheBern https://t.co/xVJooI9MIB
#Bernie critics say universal health care &amp; free college will cost 2 much. Know what didn't cost 2 much? Bailing out Wall St. #FeelTheBern
Shameful that we need UN oversight in the USA just to have fair and honest elections. Corruption abounds. #FeelTheBern #NeverHillary
#Hillary treats common people with disdain as if they are beneath her. Imperious and pompous is not a good mix for POTUS #FeelTheBern
"#Hillary will lie, cheat, steal, overthrow govts in our name and send our children off to murder and die in war just for $$ #NeverHillary"
@Gawker @andybrwn @HillaryClinton Not Presidential material. #FrackHillary #FeelTheBern #BernieorBust
"#ImSoSick of #Hillary temper tantrums. Grow the f*ck up. Realize we don't wan't ur phony, sleazy, entitled kind 2 represent us #BernieorBust"
#ImSoSick of Clintons. Scandasl attached 2 them from #Whitewater forward. She could tell me the sky is blue and I wouldn't believe her.
"@BernieVolunteer @HillaryClinton #Hillary doesn't have the decorum 2B POTUS.  Nobody cares what ur ""sick of"". I'm #sickofher #BernieorBust"

Geez @BarbraStreisand stick 2 singing if u can't figure out how taking Wall St. bribes is something 99% of us might B against. #BernieorBust
@BarbraStreisand @HillaryClinton Babs Wall St. wrecked our economy. How u gonna fix that and bring them to bear if u take their bribes?
@NancyLeeGrahn @Tonjawalker Wall St will have to pay if laws are enacted and enforced. Wall St. doesn't rule the world.
If I didn't trust #Hillary in 08 for Pres. BEFORE she sent TOP SECRET emails from an unsecured server why would I NOW? #NeverHillary
@NancyLeeGrahn @Tonjawalker I'm #BernieorBust because @SenSandes is the ONLY candidate concerned about the issues that matter to the people.
Hey NY HRC thinks ur not important enuf 2 debate 4 your vote. How u like them apples? She don't like a Brooklyn tone. #ToneDownForWhat
Since all #Bernie fans R Berniebots &amp; fictitious looks like the #Hillbullies could get ONE positive trend going for HRC. #ToneDownForWhat
#Hillary says #BernieSanders tone is negative b/c he is stating facts about her record. Facts &amp; HIllary don't compute. #ToneDownForWhat
"Sorry DNC, the only person I'm donating to is @BernieSanders and directly on his website. #NeverHillary. #BernieorBust #ToneDownForWhat"
