@LadyBarberBrown It's almost as if getting anyone in the govt to feel any urgency about anything is like pulling teeth.
@JL00t Full list of California Senate 2016 candidates with some info on each of them: https://t.co/yWjNw88JGB.
"@JL00t Well there are 34 people running for Senator, and some of them are #Berniecrats: @NotDoNothing, @Stokes4Senate @VoteForEmory"
@MACJMcQ @JordanChariton Progressives should look for somebody now to run in 2018 before the Dem machine picks somebody.
@AndyKirn @JordanChariton SOS Bowen de-activated all the systems for a time in 2007 then re-instated three of them. https://t.co/Ufulh7in8c
@jbrohnson @ElizLanders @BernieSanders https://t.co/TY6Buycc5R
@TomSteyer It'd be better if they weren't trapped in a system that appears to require these thieves. Living wages would help.
@cwhitehead73 @Brenda_Rocksxo @gdebenedetti It's not that much different from what Hillary is doing nationally. https://t.co/4l4xoXxpXP
@cwhitehead73 @Brenda_Rocksxo @gdebenedetti CA FPPC may fine CA state senator Tony Strickland $80K for funneling $ thru county committees.
"@maryandrosa The problem with that is that I think NPP voters can't vote for Bernie by mail, only with a Dem ballot at a polling place."

Former CA state senator Tony Strickland laundered large donations through Repub party county committees - https://t.co/LRffJNimeE
"@DerekCressman Also, isn't this money-laundering through committees more or less the same scheme Hillary is using nationally?"

@billmon1 Gov Ronald Reagan changed that starting in 1968. He instituted tuition in order to dampen student political activity.
"@billmon1 Some ""incidental"" and registration fees started getting added in 1921. By 1968 those added up to $300/year."
@billmon1 For folks who don't know California history: Univ of CA was tuition-free from inception in 1868 til 1970. https://t.co/Irx13wxqd2
@gengberg @shempenny Interesting! This is so California. Anyone know where in #Oakland this is?
@SaVonniYestanti @BernieSanders Very cool! Thanks for sharing. :)
Some California folks are reporting that their voter registrations have been invalidated due to DMV incorrectly telling SOS they've moved.

"@amyzworldamy Ah, well, that's a good one. I'd like to credit whoever took it."
@amyzworldamy Beautiful. Did you take that?
@cathleendecker @BernieSanders @HillaryClinton That's a critical distinction for Bernie supporters.
"@cathleendecker @BernieSanders @HillaryClinton The SuperPAC helping Sanders isn't for corporate donations, it's for nurses union members."
