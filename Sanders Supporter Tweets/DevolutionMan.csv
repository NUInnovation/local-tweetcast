@tinasimms2 🙏🏼
@ObiHawkKenobi @NBCNightlyNews Money can never compensate time. Its terrible.
People who don't courtesy flush at work are diabolical monsters.  😖
@ObiHawkKenobi @SeahawkValdez @ICC_00 Bullies are the lowest type of human.
@sarahcolonna You actually met on twitter? Thats awesome.
@RainingOnU @walottery I did the same thing. 😡
@walottery Thanks. Maybe send out a tweet so customers don't try and correct the issue on their own phones? 😡#communication
@36JIH36 Hell yes! Its your day! Live like a boss!
@carissajanuary If your 2nd choice is Ted Cruz then you're either desperate or cursed. Hahaha
@carissajanuary Its actually dumber than it was when Palin was running as vice President. That seems impossible. 😕
@K_Law2nice Get ready to get that trophy.
@carissajanuary Ive never felt like an election has been this long.
My daughter text me that she's going to come home from school cause she can't stay awake. 1st day she missed in a year. #sleepyday
@Postal_SeaHawk Im with you bro. Its a strange Monday.
@mari_sea_12 Thanks that really helped. https://t.co/KO3J74kifj
@carissajanuary Must be nice. 👏🏼😢
Is everyone sleepy this morning? Its kicking my butt.
@ArrDJay @Q_JEFF That is very cool. 👍🏼
Im all for protesting but these guys are aholes.  https://t.co/XeZUH5I4Yi
@carissajanuary Its the most time consuming. lol
@TheCatGentleman @TBpnw @PearlJam I need to go to that.
"How about just protest and don't break sh!t. Thank you, the rest of us."
@TwelveInOregon @pzf That looks biblical.
@up2n19 @walottery LOL
@TheCatGentleman @walottery Maybe you're special.
"@TheCatGentleman @walottery I removed and reinstalled and it still says ""App is under maintenance"""
For those concerned about traffic in Seattle for May Day I drove through from the ferry dock and made every light. just saying.
@drew_ajeto @gabbyajeto It pressure washes with sand.
Everyone please retweet or tweet to @walottery Their app has been down all weekend and I need to check my tickets. This is so important. 🤔😜
"@TheDrtyChinaman @PharmaBlue How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, practice, practice."
@HooliganHawk Water and soap
@TheDrtyChinaman @PharmaBlue Remember if you use the left its like someone else is doing it. 😮
A month we can all pull for. 😂 https://t.co/R5IrgKZlNC
@walottery What's the deal with your app? Its been having maintenance for 2 days? Come on man!
@carissajanuary It is. Even the Rep's I know may be confused but they are not flat out racist.
@carissajanuary It gives a bad name to the other perfectly sane non-racist caucasian in the world.
@Soundtechdez Wow...
@carissajanuary Dear lord that's disturbing. Its become acceptable I guess.
@carissajanuary Where was it?
Where is the May day protest in Seattle so I can avoid it on my way home from the ferry terminal?
@SPRC2 He was terrible. His on air rant on how great the 49ers were gonna be on the first game of the season was epic.
@HawkoftheSea @businessinsider If thats it they are just mad they can't say the N word with an R at the end.
@K_Law2nice Its home now. Welcome! #Seahawks
@MoneyLynch Whats up Money? We miss you already!
@Gaychel22 @TheCatGentleman 😂😳😂
@JenniferDolin @cbekius Im old damit! Hahaha
@Cougarjohn81 The event is in the Mandalay Bay so I might stay there.
Going to Vegas in August. What's a great hotel? I haven't been there since 2008. I was thinking Bellagio?
@36JIH36 Weren't they all sweaty in that episode? Hahaha
@Softykjr I have him blocked but its always special to read the negative drivel. ICB
Miley said he just wants to get back to fishing.
Mariners are getting pretty flipping good. Just don't play me and break my heart. Hahaha
@36JIH36 Im serious. The dude that practically saved my life was a Muslim. Best friend growing up black. Wife Asian. Color means nothing.
@36JIH36 It usually has to do with you being an ahole. Hahaha Its just easier to live colorblind.
@36JIH36 I grew up in the hood. I get along with everyone.
@JenniferDolin I'll never dab and will prevent others from doing so.
@36JIH36 Race relations in the US are crazy.
@Jake_B23 He made TV! Follow a new father! https://t.co/Y6VkPjgm7j
@36JIH36 I like how they say Redskins is in honor of Native American's.
"Miley's new show on Discovery ""The Deadliest Pitch""."
@gascan27 @TBpnw I haven't enjoyed a singles bar in a while.
@36JIH36 Some people have no chill.
@TBpnw Did anyone ask your sign yet?
@TheCatGentleman @TK421M I just thought you really wanted to streak.
@Jake_B23 @HighHawk1 @ROOTSPORTS_NW Congrats!!!! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
That was a bad hit. How about a grand Salami now?
Coca Cola really got a leg up on the competition by using cocaine on its original formula. It would be like selling a heroin burger.
"@TheCatGentleman @Almae1 Meth isn't bad, well unless you start using it. lol"
@Almae1 There are far far worse addictions.
"@Almae1 ""Hello, my name is Alison and Im a bootcamp addict."""
@Almae1 He knows you're a stalker...yet harmless.
@BillSimmons Im not paying for that no matter what they push.
@colmelg So delicious.
@TheCatGentleman My coworker said its a great sightseeing trip that nobody knows about.
@RayMarkAble1 Thanks for the tips! 👍🏼
@billrabe111 Im taking the ferry thats less traveled Bremerton to Seattle. Gonna take some pictures.
@TheCatGentleman After 22 years up here this will be my first trip on that ferry. How sad is that? Hahaha
@TheCatGentleman Bremerton to Seattle. Its just something to do thats cheap. Trying to save.
Tomorrow taking the wife on a ferry ride because yard work is done!!!
Nice bunt followed by nice hit. #Mariners
@AKGrown12 YES!
@jeffd_23 The players are fine. The team no.
"@billrabe111 ""Sweep the leg! Do you have a problem with that Mr. Lawrence?"""
OKC loses 92 to 124 LMAO!
Miley still reminds me of a veteran deckhand on the Deadliest Catch.
@Cougarjohn81 lol
@Cougarjohn81 Living in the Bay Area during their glory years made my 49er hate damn near perfect.
I get so much pleasure from watching teams I despise lose. 49ers and OKC top that list.
Mariners starting to kick some ass. Nice...
@36JIH36 its 109 to 74
@36JIH36 I want 4 games like that.
Just turned on the game to see OKC getting destroyed. What a great night. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
@zonahawk @Rand_Getlin Sweet
"@carissajanuary Well, I see the nannies little helper in blue."
Whats great about Washington is having to do yardwork on the sunny days of the year. 😕
@gascan27 I'll be so famous I wont be able to do that.
It I ever become famous my first act will be to delete all old twitter posts. Hahaha
@36JIH36 @josephmuldoon @BillyAndersonYo Its been drunk bro. Sorry... Look for a red sock.
This is classic! Hahaha https://t.co/vxXPI7q9sE
@billrabe111 Prosise to WR maybe.
@36JIH36 @josephmuldoon @BillyAndersonYo Maybe you used it to filter some pruno?
Day 3 of the draft is a commercial with some draft news sprinkled in.
"@MyersNFL @AaronQ13Fox Regardless, I see the rookie getting the business over this. Hahaha"
@36JIH36 Looks like you got jacked son. 😜
UCLA kickers name is a mouthful.
@billrabe111 Rawls is as close to a Lynch as I've seen.
@CB_is_Legend Thats why Im not a GM. lol
"PC and JS know what they are doing but it just seems we have too many RB. But hey, what do I know."
@jazzorion I thought they'd pick him with this pick.
So I guess we have sights on a UDFA for QB?
@Brainman365 @colmelg @CorleoneWilbur Fanatical murderous atheist are fairly rare.
@DaveZ_uk Its like cocaine. Be Careful bingeing.
They need to have the draft and then start the season 6 weeks later.
@josephmuldoon But you're fairly famous sir. 😜
Looks like @Q_JEFF is going to be a great fit in Seattle. Hard working family guy.
I see another OLineman then on the a WR.
Lawyer in the house!
@Gresh49 I think a gigantic football player on a Vespa should always have the right of way.
"@josephmuldoon @FieldGulls ""Smooth like butter"" needs to really make a comeback."
@up2n19 @dopehighness Thats the eternal question.
Well he found the right team!  https://t.co/ERrpaTVcfv
@TBpnw Can you please use it in a sentence?
@antmay @komonews 6.5 feet of over 300? Dear lord.
WHAT A CATCH!!!!
@fuzzybunny_feet I just said that. Hahaha
LOL That experiment is over. https://t.co/MPBI9bh5kx
@KingPRO_20 @Seahawks Great to get you in Seattle. Really liked the way you played at ND.
"@CheezieBreezie @McLovinDenise @allrachel @Soundtechdez I was just telling my wife about them and said ""That's them right there!"" Hahaha"
Look who made TV @McLovinDenise @allrachel @Soundtechdez https://t.co/2sVRC7gFkF
@TimGardner2OT Wait till these late rounds and the UFA after! Whoa...
@TimGardner2OT Best draft we've had in my opinion. Addressed lots of needs.
@ICC_00 That looks so natural.
@MyersNFL @ftermatth Thats rough.
Mariners break up the no-no for @McLovinDenise and @allrachel
"Draft Recap: 

Seahawks are gonna need a bigger plane."
@CheezieBreezie @gbellseattle He knows what's up. 😉
@TimGardner2OT After that kind of injury you never know how good he's gonna be. Its a good move.
Pete and John pick players like mad scientists.
We're having a kickass draft!!!!
@valleylove40 They talked over the Cards pick to talk about the Pats pick for 5 minutes.
@valleylove40 Yep
@SportScream Good point.
Who do we want for these next 3 picks? 😁
@TBpnw @Gaychel22 This figures...
@Soundtechdez @allrachel @McLovinDenise Nice!
@CheezieBreezie @wbnc lol
@CheezieBreezie Light a candle please. lol
@irliteach Ditto!
We picked a Seattle sports fan? Thats awesome! @1j_reed Welcome home! #SeahawksDraft  https://t.co/pja288YQmo
Hows the wedding reception! Post more pics!
@psalmblogger That was sweet
@McLovinDenise Hahaah
@McLovinDenise @udubgal @allrachel Congrats and great luck to both of you!
@McLovinDenise Is that the magic room Johnny? lol
@mari_sea_12 Freaking thieves! I was robbed while moving also. It sucks.
"Now I've got that feeling once again

I can't explain, you would not understand

This is not how I am

I have become comfortably numb"
@antmay @Q13FOX We need Tom Cruise out there.
@tinasimms2 🙏🏼
@FauxJohnMadden @RapSheet This is called a debriefing and programming. See Lee Harvey Oswald's wife 1963.
"@MyersNFL @alyankovic @nfldraftscout Mine would be ""Sweat"" by the C&amp;C Music Factory."
I hope the @Mariners know that a great couple is having their reception at the ballpark tonight! Congrats to @allrachel and @McLovinDenise
@PLUTim It happened like 20 years ago and nobody was killed. Lets bring up real transgressions like millions killed invading Iraq.
@PLUTim @thehill This is brilliant! Blame the wife! This is very Sharia law like.
@Imeraldgurl @DavidRomeiPHD @mtredden What if its the judge who's unconscious?
I blame twitter for pulling me into the draft. 😕
@TwelveInOregon @drummerhawkboy8 Lets hope he plays the same. Hahaha
"@JenniferDolin FedX, cause he delivers on Sunday. Hahaha"
@JenniferDolin 😄😄😄
@JenniferDolin FedX
His name is 👀Fed👀
@SanhoTree @Reuters Obviously Trump doesn't know the history of America First. 🤔
@sportsfan0610 @CHawk_Talk #BOOM
@TheCatGentleman He's not wearing a gas mask... Im down!
The kid is excited! Great pick.
@CheezieBreezie We know you would sister. 😉
We got our guy anyway.
Butler dabbed in his video. Glad we didn't get him.
I like players with easy names to spell.
I wanna see the gasp from the 49er draft party. lol
