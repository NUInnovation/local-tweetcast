@WeLoveBernie1 good pic of trump there!
@camerongirl Im sorry you live in such denial. Thats the ignorance that dooms us right there.
@camerongirl research the cfr
@camerongirl this is why i feel american voters are ignorant
@camerongirl hoping bernie goes 3d party #BernieOrBust
@camerongirl question for you... Is trump a member of the cfr?(council on foreign relations)
@camerongirl why would i vote for a man who changes his stance on things whenever it suits him? I dont trust hes not establishment either.
@PeoplesMediaLA This could get him assassinated of course.  But all the good ones do tend to get shot at.#BernieOrBust
@camerongirl @_metafizik @journalschism @BernieSanders why support the travesty of the corporate masters beating the ppl again?
@ShaunKing sadly with every vote she gets shes proven right. #HillNo #BernieOrBust
@CurmudgeonZ @SalamMorcos EXACTLY! I honestly feel #HillaryClinton supporters live in denial of the death grip on their throats by oligarchs
@SalamMorcos Why then would they support hillary??? #HillNo #BernieOrBust
@QueenPhillippa @Crazy_Kidneys true... All bring their own values.
@nmeeder @Bernie_Facts why?  Trump would at least try to get our jobs back from bad tradedeals the man shed put in charge of trade made orig
@Crazy_Kidneys @QueenPhillippa Yeah who said there was any status boost to being white? As 1/4 cherokee i feel white is the lesser value.
@JoyAnnReid It never mattered before who won cuz all candidates were puppets.  We only care now because one of them finally isn't. #bernie
@morgantaylor103 @Bernie_Facts You're right.  #BernieSanders should abandon the party that no longer shares his uplifting values.
Completely lost it seems.  #bernie shows us the true path but those without vision refuse to see. https://t.co/tWuN5PJ7pp
Awesome reasoning for bernie to break free and run as 3d party! #BernieOrBust https://t.co/7GMGMQ6mdz

Way to attack the globalist agenda.  Nice suggestion! https://t.co/QFIdcBmAq0 https://t.co/hjSViGIbVy

Completely agree.  Her rare Progressive platforms are only ways to blackmail big $ interests to cut her a check! https://t.co/NvbB17MBCq

The system is rigged!  #BernieOrBust!  THIS is why we need this revolution! https://t.co/9MqroPz61j"
Understanding this article in light of what #BernieSanders is trying to accomplish is priceless! Read/RT! https://t.co/QFIdcBmAq0
"@SYounessian @Skidman61 @PoliticsPeach @GOP As always, one snake, two heads."
"@mario_chappell @EdenGosuto @Bernie_Facts but THE issue, making a stand against the corruption and rigging by the wealthy is not. #HillNo"
@randy_ratliffKC So are you saying its just fine to back a politician that sells out her voters just because shes female?
@AarDayburnin @eclecticbrotha just because we dont back corporatists does not make us sexist
@AarDayburnin @eclecticbrotha i was replying to somene claiming that its sexist to want her to just stop and #dropouthillary
