@dawn_com congratulations.
@HuffPostIndia ok this should end the controversy
PM Narendra Modi's BA Degree 'Authentic': Delhi University https://t.co/8ZrPXMrUXY via @HuffPostIndia
@Neta2lead I don't understand why people blindly support someone. Why not dig the facts first and then come to a conclusion. Not that hard!
@Neta2lead social media will expose all to all. I think now the public will probably think before voting. It's high time
@somphenomenon @SARDARDUDE @msisodia printed !
"उसने चाय बेचीं लेकिन किसी ने पी नहीं
उसने शादी की लेकिन किसी को बताया नहीं
उसने पढ़ाई की लेकिन कोई साथ नही पढ़ा
उसने डिग्री ली लेकिन ...."
@gyan_vb @msisodia most of the institutes proudly fix a tile/ piece of marble to boast of the names of famous people who have studied there
@dracula99 @msisodia atleast you acknowledged thanks.
@msisodia love your work Sir !
@saumil2703 jethmalani has also called the current BJP leadership a jumla
@saumil2703 i am not saying it's illegal I am saying it's unethical
@saumil2703 @kapsology oh yea the BJP mole in aap much like Bedi. Why don't you go and ask jethmalani
@saumil2703 says 'last year' this is 2016 last is 2015. Aap came to power last year. Actually even before that as we had elections twice
@saumil2703 BJP was not in power in Delhi for the last 11 years atleast
@gyan_vb @msisodia why security outside records room? Let the people see. Usually institutes proudly display degrees of PM pres etc hanji ?
@gyan_vb @msisodia but this issue  is modi's degrees. We will go there as well but for now this one. Excuses and wrongs can't make a right.
@saumil2703 you know what happened with Audit. It's a setback for the people in general. You're rejoicing that ? Thats anti National.
@saumil2703 @kapsology did they take the laser printer back in time or print only his degree in printing press cos others are hand written
@gyan_vb @msisodia are u talking of modi uncle or have you deflected the issue in another direction ?
@saumil2703 I have given you the proof. There is no assumption here it's in black and white.
@saumil2703 @kapsology oh the case . lol the one where mr jethmalani is defending him. Ex BJP leader mr jethmalani hahahaha
@saumil2703 @kapsology did I say Farzi? If you were a lawyer your client would have surely been on death row mate! Don't jump to conclusions
@saumil2703 @kapsology kejri won an assembly seat. Jetli was nominated to Rs. Rs is for scholars or people excelling in some field.
@saumil2703 @kapsology they can penalty which can be challenged in court.
@gyan_vb @msisodia seriously ?
@somphenomenon @SARDARDUDE @msisodia did they take the laser printer back in time to print. Even my mark sheets up to 1996 are hand written
@dracula99 @msisodia that is his work. I voted for him and I want him to check. He represents me . I am from Delhi.
@Dwari1008 @msisodia don't divert the issue. Issue is that of the pm. The nation needs to know 'is the pm a 420?
@aapdelhincr @msisodia why is every thing in the country named after these thieves.
@Neta2lead nice one . The same is with jet-Li . Lost in elections and still fm. We have really scaled the peak of bullshit mountain.
@autumnrainwish do it but only if cctv installations are mandatory in bedrooms. Can't trust anyone these days.
@autumnrainwish @akshatasbp @dhrubo127 it is no different to racism or discrimination. Even the govt does it. SC/STYou are wasting your time
@saumil2703 @kapsology Delhi Govt: 345 new schools opened last year https://t.co/MXvZE5h2Pb via @sharethis
@saumil2703 @kapsology might be but now the matter is sub judicial so JNU has no say in it
@saumil2703 @kapsology that fool lost in elections. The fraud is still the finance minister. Wah
@saumil2703 I am only talking of developement not red tape and blame game
@saumil2703 @kapsology https://t.co/6QnRILwkCi
@saumil2703 @kapsology all of these are being delivered. Been there seen it. Joke is on you bhakt.
@saumil2703 @kapsology how can you brand someone anti Nat. When the matter is subjudice. Common sense.
@saumil2703 @kapsology google it
@saumil2703 @kapsology Last year when uncle modi went to states most of the drug prices were pushed up many fold. Ask any chemist. Jumla!
@saumil2703 @kapsology gas subsidy yea again this was debated time and again but only not implemented because of the poor.
@saumil2703 @kapsology electrification of villages program was started by Cong .
@autumnrainwish @_vivek_nair if you don't rust the state / enforcement / judiciary what can I say. There is a process and system to follow.
@saumil2703 @kapsology OROP has been in the making for the last 10 years. The one passed is also a joke. Ex service men still for aap.
@autumnrainwish @_vivek_nair why are you abusing me? Just because I don't understand your illogical rhetoric of the caste card ?
"@autumnrainwish @_vivek_nair What is worse hate crime or rape ?
What carries a harsher sentence ?
Isn't this discussion at a dead end."
@autumnrainwish @_vivek_nair Let the enforcement agencies and court do their job. I have faith in that state atleast.
@autumnrainwish @_vivek_nair who is Jisha. I am sure the perpetrators will be punished regardless of angles of caste or hate
@saumil2703 @kapsology put in place by congress &amp; their policies BJP just reaping rewards. Like that J&amp;K train.
@autumnrainwish @_vivek_nair education &amp; liberalism go hand in hand. Rapes/murders are more prevalent in states with low literacy.
@autumnrainwish @_vivek_nair I thought Kerala was the state with 95% plus literacy. Have you ever been there ? It's a fantastic tourist loc.
@saumil2703 @kapsology what is vikas ? I think there is a need to educate you people on the basic definition
@saumil2703 @kapsology not only India but the developed world including USA applauded odd even and Mohalla clinic initiatives
@saumil2703 @kapsology did u even go to school or just got bhaktjan to fit a brick up there?
@saumil2703 @kapsology bro even the scientists rubbished the claims of bhakts that odd even will not bring pollution level down.
@saumil2703 @kapsology 11 years later where is it ? Why production not strayed after 15000 crore loans?
@RoflCritic @electric_rahul one needs brains to fool someone. They are like a kid of 3rd grade trying to hide the spilled sugar. Lol
@HartoshSinghBal @electric_rahul @narendramodi All jumla! Turning a self sufficient farmer into a factory worker is developement? Baniya raj
@narendramodi Punjab and Haryana portray a different picture. Why ?
@saumil2703 @kapsology don't ask. Present info and facts.
@saumil2703 @kapsology let's talk GuJ development. Why is it still not in the top 5 states ? Patel protests there too.  Sab jumla !
@saumil2703 @kapsology let's talk kg basin gujrat. @56 inch said there is how much gas ? Since 2005 and 15000 crore later Production still 0
@saumil2703 @kapsology tomar was dragged to the cell. Was he not ! Did aap try to shield him? No.
@saumil2703 @kapsology let's talk about hooliganism in hR and rapes in haryana recently. BJP in power. Farmer suicides in pb BJP there too
@saumil2703 @kapsology @arvindrathor8 if he really believes kejri is to apologise. He's lost it. The result of teachers paying for jobs.
@saumil2703 @kapsology @arvindrathor8 Most of the bhakts can be judged by profile pics. fukras on bullshit mountain&amp; disregard 4 humanity.
@saumil2703 @kapsology maybe u are referring to quota where common people = bhakts.
@saumil2703 @kapsology @arvindrathor8 sorry for what. Asking about truth ?
"@shalinibhardw45 @me_ravi2007 heard'f kg basin in GuJ, claims of modi. 2005 . It's 2016 now and 15000 crore later no oil yet. Jumla !"
@anuraggemini bhai kg basin junmla to yaad hi hoga! 15000 crores later and 11 years on. Where is the oil. Jhooth Ki had hai yaar.
@rainy_leone @madhukishwar lesson 4 BJP. Need 2 scooters for odd even in Delhi. Triple riding? Challan? Chalo lesson 2.
@1117ashish @madhukishwar @BHANWARLALSUTH7 or the fools woke up !
@AAP_ka_KAMAL @madhukishwar nice.Now the mla's which were bought by BJP are like - dhobi ke kutte. BJP - dhobi booted out of the empty plot.
@attorneybharti happy birthday sir!
The KG(aseous) balloon: The end of the Modi dream? https://t.co/L7bvpmCiSI via @sharethis
@anuraggemini banao pond Karo Aquire but farmers should be stakeholders
@anuraggemini no they weren't I know as I am one. Give 3 times and make them stake holders based on holding size and projected future value.
@pcpandey @Iamdeshmukh @kapsology @ashutosh83B bhakts need some thc to chill the fuck out and get their heads out of their orifices.
@bnicetosam @kapsology @meetcrazydude you will be surprised ! Zara Punjab Haryana Ja ke dekhiye?
@viksbhatt @arvindrathor8 @kapsology bhai GuJ to Haryana Se bhi neeche niklaa ? Ye kaisa vikas ??? Bloody jumla !
@arvindrathor8 @viksbhatt @kapsology Bhai rss publications quote Karo gey to log haseingey hi !
@alokji316 @shreeha12 @kapsology @iamalirt @meetcrazydude @AamAadmiParty aisi photo Rahul Ki bhi hai. Trend setter bhi wahi hai. Your point!
@saumil2703 @kapsology @arvindrathor8 bhaktjan Ka channel &amp; rss headquarters mein kiya poll! Tv channel dekhta hai koi aapiya? Social media
@IamSaQeeb @alokji316 @iamalirt @kapsology @meetcrazydude modi = trump and bhaktjan= racist fools.
@meetcrazydude @hallagullaboy go and see the work  in aap constituencies in Punjab and Delhi. Seen the new govt schools in Delhi?
@alokji316 @kapsology @iamalirt @meetcrazydude aur Isi Ko India Le aaye. And then bezati complete! Lol
@alokji316 @kapsology @iamalirt @meetcrazydude I do go there to eat kebabs and nihari. No one makes better than them. Stop fear mongering!
@anuraggemini it is also in Punjab for the last 9 and the result has been atrocious.
@anuraggemini that is because the govt is not investing money and knowledge where it should.
@anuraggemini rain water harvesting underground tanks drip system replenish the water table. Canals in PB usually end up in RJ hR or del.
@anuraggemini also a farmer. I can tell they are not happy. They want my formula wherein they will give up 5/6th of life earning for 1/6th.
@anuraggemini some land is always better than no land. You don't need sun and sand in 2016 to raise plants. Govt can help with the rest.
@anuraggemini not 3 times. Only 1 time -rate of 2030. Pegged to inflation of real estate.14 years only 1/6th of my life. I am doing a favor.
@anuraggemini businessmen They have thousands of acres &amp; crores. Make'em pay. Also politicians &amp; govt &amp;use the 2030 formula.
@anuraggemini farmer is a farm owner. Why do you want to reduce the farmer's haisiyat to that of a naukar. This is the problem.
@anuraggemini no no no. market rate as of 2030 calculated on inflation pegged to realestate today. Still a favor because it's lost for ever
@anuraggemini they are not doing us a favor. Merely doing their jobs. Congress however even failed to do that.
@anuraggemini It was the same during the 18 standard acre ruling when the Indian govt snatched our lands. Have you no shame. How many times?
@anuraggemini make the farmer the share holder. Or he should be able to lease the land at the rate of the market then
@anuraggemini not till the business men and the real rich play with high stakes.
@anuraggemini maybe the ambani and adanis of the country should put in a lot more effort to develop rural infra. They have looted trillions.
@anuraggemini are you an agricultural expert. This is 2016. Food can be grown without sun and without sand.
@anuraggemini businesses should pay for it . They should pay more than 5 times. Farmers have had the short end of the rope for the last 60yr
@anuraggemini I won't ever support a baniya sarkar. They are the blood suckers. Businesses should pay for pushing up agricultural output.
@anuraggemini have u been there . Hub of manufacturing is also in gurgon and manesar.
@anuraggemini bhai Saab why don't u star with throwing 1 crore into the pool and bail out some farmers
@anuraggemini why should only one section suffer. Everyone should pay and businessmen should pay more . Don't they have mouths ?
@anuraggemini lets snatch land from anyone who has more than 20 acres &amp; also take away excessive wealth over 25 crores &amp; then do what u want
@anuraggemini beating around the bush ! We need to bail out farmers from private lenders first. can't snatch livelihood to make it better
@anuraggemini I am not a congress supporter mate ! I am against oligarchy !
@anuraggemini what did the farmer get ?
@anuraggemini it is the duty of the govt to ensure everyone has access to food education medicine and energy. Fdi is a different issue.
@anuraggemini fdi can't do much if majority of the population cannot afford food/ energy &amp; govt edu. focussed on religious indoctrination
@tadeep @im_javedkhan @ArvindKejriwal @AamAadmiParty since independence kids should have been the first priority. Atleast someone woke up!
@dream_India @autumnrainwish @AkshayTeotiax please name them. I only know of modiji and the hrd minister. Btw Tomar was dragged to the cell
@himansh2606 @autumnrainwish @ArvindKejriwal he was dragged to the cell. If you are drawing similarities !
@autumnrainwish @bhatia_anshu maybe educated leaders who work on issues that target a larger population base rather than a financial base
@autumnrainwish @bhatia_anshu most of our enforcement ie police I am sure isn't even aware of it.
@bhatia_anshu @autumnrainwish correct
@autumnrainwish @bhatia_anshu that also happened in Haryana during the protests / riots and the people/ police didn't do anything
@bhatia_anshu @autumnrainwish have to have proper investigation not trial by media that would be a dangerous trend.
@priyankkela @ArvindKejriwal @mediacrooks but they do since they are owned by our established politicians.....
@DhwaniPandyaMD @ArvindKejriwal like ?
@AAPInNews BJP is proud of bringing in OROP why are they supporting AAP? Wonder why ?
@msisodia @AAPInNews love your work.
@salilrajhans @AamAadmiParty two wrongs don't make a right.
