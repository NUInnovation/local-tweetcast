@AkireYreuq you catalogue ur sleeping? COOL O:
"@AkireYreuq sleep is literally the best medicine??? If I have a severe migraine, a good 10+ hours of sleeping = CURED"
@AkireYreuq I am not a ball of sunshine on depressive mornings omg my patience becomes so thin
"@AkireYreuq all four of us, whether continuing with her or not, all agreed she was awful ;P"
@AkireYreuq cause I'm BROOKEN when I'm LOOOOONESOOOOME
@helenasrender actually the gym has been so emo today- they played Cold by Crossfade and Animal I've Become by TDG LMAO
"People who post relationship memes on FB got me like:
Yes we get it. Ur in the honeymoon phase, y'all are struggling or you're lonely. Stfu"
... Am I seriously listening to Seether ft. Any Lee rn
"Listen
Nothing matters more than taking the chances that your mental illnesses may take from you."
She crosses that line by like a mile.
I've worked with tons of different directors and I know the difference between being tough on someone and being absolutely rude
And for those of them that decided to continue working with her... What brave souls
I love how everyone working under Marlette collectively thinks she's downright disrespectful lmao
There is barely any will to continue oh my God
Oh my G o d if this girl don't shut the fuck up.......

""Here's another conservative opinion you didn't ask for"""
And quite frankly I've had enough? So now if ppl wanna be selfish enough to voice bigoted opinions u best bet I'm gonna roast em.....
I've had to live my life having people's perspectives and opinions shoved down my damn throat without any regards to how I thought/felt
I'm sassy/salty because really whenever someone speaks out of their mouth it's cause they were unempathetic or just being real stupid.
I get a real kick out of going against the grain with my Dad on social and political problems it is FUN AS FUCK
"Not all protesters they show on the media are violent

@primadonnamezzo the majority doesn't ever determine what kind of person you want to be
"@primadonnamezzo I just, I hope people remember to celebrate their differences and embrace them; you'll find ur people don't worry"
"@primadonnamezzo idk it sounds cliche and obvious but to me, struggling with societal standards has me second guessing my own self"
"@primadonnamezzo and honestly, you don't have to do what everyone else is doing or what people think u should be doing!!!"
@primadonnamezzo like why am I not that way? Will I get to be that way?? You start to second guess urself and what you like to do
"@primadonnamezzo and being surrounded by media that tells you what you SHOULD be doing makes one feel out of place, alienated, confused ect"
"@primadonnamezzo today I'm still feeling weird about what my age group does- anything u can think of, I naturally don't do"
"@primadonnamezzo I didn't understand wanting to look good, or have boys pay attention to u, or cheating on tests... I didn't get it"
"@primadonnamezzo ever since I was little, I just... Didn't click with what everyone else was doing/wanting"
@primadonnamezzo so initially this sounds like a ~special snowflake~ thread but it is such an important topic ok
"Ok u ready for this
I need to go on a rant, and this is for my ""weirdos""/people who don't wanna conform to society"

How TF has it been a Y E A R? THE FUCK"
"@_dev_marie I wish I could directly @ him for this LOL
He blocked me cause I tweeted ""who let Ryan Wise in my house"" like months ago"
@Steveasaurous well if he gon use the N word like a dumbass I'm glad he ain't associating himself with me
"I forgot we wrote those letters... On a day like this, why TF not, top the cherry on that sucker"
Lmao Ryan Wise blocked me nice

"Y'all I'm fucking irritated n pissy rn 
If you wonder why minorities get violent, they gotta put up with this BS DAILY IS WHY"
"If you ever fucking wonder why I didn't come outta the closet and I'm 19, THIS IS WHY LOL"
"He LITERALLY said ""it's wrong for a minority to demand equal rights, people should be allowed to also be transphobic!!!"" LMAO WHAT"
"Who the fuck do you think you are justifying hate in the name of your rights? Dad, you fucking disgust me."
You're a part of the fucking problem if you can't see any problem with trans ppl feelin unsafe &amp; getting harassed in the name of ur rights
You don't wanna fucking understand you just wanna stamp your little feet and demand ur rights are more important than minorities-
"Like wow how much more ignorant, bull-headed and utterly M A L E could you get? Always gotta mansplain, always gotta win the discussion 😩"
"My dad just got into an argument with me about transgender rights and the bathroom
It ended with me laughing about his White Maleness™"
