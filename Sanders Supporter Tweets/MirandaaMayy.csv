@nicklerimer not today by imagine dragons
"Well it turned into a cold and I think I'll punch my roommate, it's not her fault but eh"
I think I've gotten to the point where I actually hate my roommate
I have a sore throat and I will punch something if this turns into a cold
I'm actually crying listening to the new @Imaginedragons song
I probably shouldn't nap because I have another test tomorrow but I did get panda 😋
What should I do to reward myself after my test today?
@_Mellliii I know! I've been counting down the days since January lmao 45 days to go 😭
My roommate makes so much goddamn noise I swear I'm going to lose it soon
The next two weeks are going to be absolute hell
I'm already sweating and it's not even 10 am
@nicklerimer why isn't neither an option?
Thanks @nicklerimer https://t.co/eOOp20XH3Q
@nicklerimer too bad
I ate a whole plate of rice and orange chicken rip in piece to me
I've never felt like I've done really bad on a math test until now 🙃
@janietimelady hahaha that was your fault
Happy #NationalSiblingDay 💩 https://t.co/GnuWPwb97I
@victoriaaaa_22 what??
I just bought my tickets for the @MagicMan concert and then @alexcaplow followed me!! Thanks man I'll see you soon 😎
Atlas Genius was so fun last night! 🎶 https://t.co/h7rRFh0UhV
@nicklerimer gross
@WALKTHEMOONband not unless you add a Seattle date
@maddie_lauer thanks Maddie!! Love you too! 😘❤️
"@wtmkevin liked my picture on instagram, this is officially the best birthday ever!"
Second tattoo 😊 https://t.co/U0dAI44soK
My birthday is tomorrow but honestly I'm more excited to see my cats on Saturday 😻
@AnnaCsicsery Utah sounds like a scary place
My roommates dad is a trump supporter and he's visiting today so I wrote this on our whiteboard https://t.co/OFc9HpeDOA
Turns out it's 72% for both
I've gotten to the point where I'm calculating the lowest possible grades I can get to still get B's
How do I get a photographic memory by Monday??
@nicklerimer you should get this one https://t.co/p72xDMIKsw
@m_hehemann me too! I spent so long on it I'd be mad if I got anything less
98% of my tweets are complaining about my roommate but this is the only drama in my life and I'm too passive aggressive to talk to her
My roommate literally sat on her ass for 5 hours today and now she decides to do homework right when I'm going to bed
really wish I had my cat to cuddle with this week
My roommate has been sick for 3 weeks and got me sick again. If her sickness doesn't kill her I will
The only way I get mail is if I buy stuff for myself
@AnnaCsicsery I'm actually going home for break tho I need to see my cats
@AnnaCsicsery sorry maybe I could get a fruity drink
@AnnaCsicsery lol it would be the perfect time but I don't like alcohol
@AnnaCsicsery spring break I'll be 19 let's do it
I seriously cannot stop laughing at this lmao what the fuck https://t.co/qlocUw6tGY
"I locked myself in one of the weird study rooms to work on my essay today, it took twice as long as I thought it would but I did it"
@nicklerimer that's amazing
I hate listening to music while studying but I have to to block out my roommate breathing
Seattle was cool 🐻✌🏻️ https://t.co/L96XLLwuFg
@nicklerimer fuck you
"Didn't plan any of it, but I had a really fun galentine's day with @nicklerimer  😊"
Sure drinking water is good for you and all but having to pee every hour isn't worth it
I have a math midterm tomorrow but all my tv shows are coming back tonight
@nicklerimer 🆗
@nicklerimer you sure?
@nicklerimer this isn't the one I told you to post
"""I'm gonna get some chocolate milk because I'm a boss ass bitch"" - @nicklerimer"
loving my new lock screen @wtmkevin https://t.co/eBzQzUVibp
@nicklerimer you  https://t.co/lbWlXNheVc
@maddie_lauer I can't wait ☺️
@maddie_lauer if only we lived in the same city 😔
@kristsalad thanks! where'd you find this?
@janietimelady 👈🏻😎👈🏻
@MirandaaMayy boy was I wrong
@maddie_lauer I love you maddie 😘
It's like my roommate forgets how to breathe quietly when she has her headphones on
@nicklerimer well too bad I'm not liam payne
@nicklerimer stop
@nicklerimer no don't say squad
@AnnaCsicsery what the fuck
@AnnaCsicsery yes I need more friends
My roommate needs to stop calling me salty. I may act like a bitch but I'm actually a big baby on the inside
@AnnaCsicsery hello we should I'm already in there for my 10am
My roommate irritated me last week and I snapped and neither of us has apologized life is good 🙃
@maddie_lauer @SincerelyTumblr you have to check on your cats no matter where you are lol
@julianna_lauren exactly! I'd rather do any of this than go out
"@julianna_lauren not yet, I'll probably watch it tomorrow but there's just so many shows I want to watch"
@julianna_lauren I did! lol And I caught up with the current season
@julianna_lauren I haven't even watched the 3rd yet
@julianna_lauren how many episodes have you watched??
People who always have their ringer on annoy me so much aka my roommate
@nicklerimer bitch
It's 8:54 and I want to go to bed
My calc professor threw his back out so he gave today's lecture over skype
@janietimelady he had a back injury
My only class tomorrow got cancelled 🤗
accidentally locked my keys in my car today 🙃
My cats stare at me when I eat cereal https://t.co/AhLDldrAx2
My sister couldn't find the Christmas wrapping paper https://t.co/daTKlAbdIW
Someone texted me saying merry Christmas and I have no idea who it is
@WWU loving it! 💙
I was accepted to @WWU a year ago today 😊
I need to shower but my cat fell asleep on my lap so I guess I can't move now
@AnnaCsicsery lol she sent me a snapchat saying the same thing
Wow I forgot how much I hate my mom's driving
I'm only home for 3 weeks my neighbor needs to cool it with the drums.
I haven't been awake this early since junior year
"I still have a full day until my last final, I just want to be done 😭"
Friendly reminder: quiet hours are 24 hours this week so please shut the fuck up
I want to go to sleep but I'd feel guilty knowing I could still be doing work
I watched 11 episodes of a 40 minute show today. Not sure if I'm proud of myself or disgusted
So excited to go home tomorrow mainly because I get to see my cats
Can it just be thanksgiving now please
Woah I really stepped out of my comfort zone this weekend and I'm so happy 😊
If my podcast gets picked to be played today I'll probably burst into flames
When I put my headphones in that means stop talking to me.
I have so much homework everyday 😭
I miss my cats 😿😿😿
"@Sierraa_West k good, I only have like 2 friends here"
"@Sierraa_West yeah that'd be cool, except I'm super awkward when meeting new people lol"
@Sierraa_West I'm in mathes
@Sierraa_West OH YEAH! WHERE DO YOU LIVE?? (that sounds super creepy)
My dinner consisted of hard boiled eggs and fries #college
So excited to see my dad this weekend 😊
@AnnaCsicsery thank you! Maybe later
I hate that I'm crying so much
I'm so homesick
Eating lunch alone after class makes me feel like a real college student
"Wow I leave in a week, this is getting real"
SO happy today is my last day of work 🙌
@potassiumdecay same
@potassiumdecay @kristsalad just some people complaining about political posts
I don't want to start anything on the wwu page but I really want to say something
"people on the fb page know western is very liberal, right?"
So excited to see @WALKTHEMOONband tonight with @janietimelady!!! 😎 http://t.co/TDj03xJa4p
It's official!!! @WWU http://t.co/hf0Hml2PjO
@hannahh_muffin 🙋
I GOT ALL THE CLASSES I WANTED WOW I'M SO RELIEVED
@AnnaCsicsery I made 3 different possible  schedules but I only like 1 of them and I will cry if I don't get it
@AnnaCsicsery yes for sure!
"@AnnaCsicsery darn, yeah. I need to get into 118"
@AnnaCsicsery are you taking the mpt tomorrow?
I was 6 feet away from @DanReynolds tonight! 😍😍 (and I touched him twice) http://t.co/XjqQTANs2Y
Thank you @Imaginedragons for such an amazing night ❤ http://t.co/hpRmPRjbBd
So worth it to pay extra to get front row at @Imaginedragons with @janietimelady  #SmokeAndMirrorsVIP
@danisnotonfire @janietimelady
"@AnnaCsicsery Taylor, actually the one you suggested I talk to!"
@AnnaCsicsery true. But you're all 5 floors away 😭
@AnnaCsicsery @potassiumdecay @ellabrooks615 @lauraful13 @hannahh_muffin I'm in mathes too but the third floor.. 306
@potassiumdecay @kristsalad @AnnaCsicsery @lauraful13 @hannahh_muffin @ellabrooks615 how the hell did all of you get the same floor!? 😭
Got matching tattoos with my mom and sister last night in Maui! 🌺 http://t.co/eLnG58HJ7O
Hawaii this week will be so much more relaxing after these past 4 days 😩😩
It's the first night of summer and I'm going to bed before 10...
Listening to On Top of the World by @Imaginedragons is very fitting for just finishing high school and my first year of college! 😃❤🎉
Done with my last final!! 😃😃 High school is finally over!!
@_Mellliii I love you too!! 💕 I'm so excited to finally see you tomorrow! 😙
Lol finished my nutrition final in 10 minutes 😂😂
"After this whole ordeal, I'm never spending my money on anyone ever again"
It feels wrong that I have homework this weekend 😩
My mom put this in the yearbook and I had no idea! ☺💕 http://t.co/lKeTKGZr1j
So much stress was just lifted off my shoulders! Thank you @potassiumdecay &amp; @lauraful13! 💙💙
This is the first Friday this quarter that I don't have some kind of test or quiz! 🙌🙌🙌
@potassiumdecay I saw that too. She and that article are so disrespectful.
@itskaciaaa I'm glad I'm not the only one that can hear it! Do you know which house it's coming from?
"I knew senior year would be stressful, but damn"
@potassiumdecay @ellabrooks615 possibly.. I think there was a fee waiver option on the confirmation fee
"@ellabrooks615 I know! That website is making me hate cats! (Not really though, I love cats)"
@ellabrooks615 SAME! it's so frustrating!
"""@janietimelady: Rest In Peace Great Grandma Lu. I'm so impressed that you made it to 95 👼❤️"""
2 months until Hawaii!!🌴🌺🌊
It's #CollegeDecisionDay and I'm so excited to spend the next 4 years of my life at @WWU! #wwubound http://t.co/wN73Tvafvi
"@potassiumdecay @bethanyaliciaaa same, I'm not going either and I don't really care"
"@hannahh_muffin same, I only have like 2 friends to begin with and I already don't see them a lot"
@potassiumdecay of course! 💞
"@potassiumdecay it'll be hard, but we'll be okay 💙 if we both end up in Mathes you can always stop by my room for food and Disney movies 💕"
@potassiumdecay @bethanyaliciaaa wait what?!
Only 1 class today! 🙌🙌
@potassiumdecay YAS! That works too!!
@potassiumdecay it's in November
"@potassiumdecay we'll be sophomores by then, will we all still be in Mathes?"
@potassiumdecay but isn't the election in 2016?
I have a roommate!! Now I really can't wait until September!  😀💙💕
@Wash1DtonZarry I found my class picture from first grade and Jack was in it! Haha
I just skyped with a potential roommate for over 5 hours! I hope this works out!
@potassiumdecay @lauraful13 @Wash1DtonZarry @Dan4signals today was so fun! We definitely need to do that again!
@potassiumdecay @Wash1DtonZarry yeah of course! My front passenger door is working again so you won't have to sit in the back! Lol
@Wash1DtonZarry @potassiumdecay okay! So we'll meet tomorrow at 1 in building 29??
@potassiumdecay @Wash1DtonZarry I am too!
