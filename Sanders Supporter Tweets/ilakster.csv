@ProAmericana @ThatExLiberal @WhitestRabbit_ What an intelligent response. üòêüòÇ Sad little human you are.
üòÇ https://t.co/rhGr5W7eva
"@ThatExLiberal @WhitestRabbit_ You ignore science and any explanation other than ""race""."
"@ThatExLiberal @WhitestRabbit_ People are people. Humans are humans. You need science, dude. I'm done with this conversation."
"@ThatExLiberal @ProAmericana @WhitestRabbit_ Like I said, research beyond the simple answer that you have come to believe."
@ThatExLiberal @WhitestRabbit_ Look more into why things may be the way they are instead of writing it off as race.
"@ThatExLiberal @WhitestRabbit_ If that's true, I don't know, but there are many facts that it could be. I don't jump on someone's race."
@ThatExLiberal @WhitestRabbit_ There are other factors that contribute to what has happened.
@ThatExLiberal @WhitestRabbit_ You should really look at more factors than just whether or not people have been slaves at some point
@ThatExLiberal @ProAmericana @WhitestRabbit_ Do you see what factors contribute to low IQ?
@ThatExLiberal @WhitestRabbit_ https://t.co/TuLT0bNUxZ
@WhitestRabbit_ You are ignorant as fuck.
"@ThatExLiberal @ProAmericana @WhitestRabbit_ consider history and how recent things have gone down in this country. ie. Slavery, segregation"
@ThatExLiberal @ProAmericana @WhitestRabbit_ have to do with someone's skin color. Correlation isn't necessarily causation. In this case...
@ThatExLiberal @ProAmericana @WhitestRabbit_ There are a lot of things that contribute to certain statistics you might see that don't...
"@ThatExLiberal @ProAmericana @WhitestRabbit_ Show me proof. Plus, you really aren't considering the history of treatment of their community"
@ThatExLiberal @ProAmericana @WhitestRabbit_ And people with differences are worse people? Ridiculous.
"@ThatExLiberal @ProAmericana @WhitestRabbit_ Continue to prove your ignorance to me, yes. Keep talking out of your ass."
@WhitestRabbit_ Do you even know the science behind why people have different skin colors?
"@WhitestRabbit_ Haha! Yes, go to some talking points that you have heard enough times to begin to believe."
@ProAmericana @WhitestRabbit_ Haha. Prove it? No thanks. I don't go around finding people to question. I just happen to see this post.
@ProAmericana @WhitestRabbit_ LOL. You people are nut cases. You think that because YOU base things on race that everyone else does too.
"@WhitestRabbit_ If I am brainwashed, then at least I am not hurting anyone from it. You, though, perpetuate hate and division. Good for youüòê"
"@WhitestRabbit_ Wow, you're ridiculous. No, I commented because I just happen to see your post when I was looking through trending hashtags"
"#WhatTheyDontWantUsToKnow Bernie is the strongest candidate, by far, to face the Republican in November."
"@WhitestRabbit_ Who brainwashed you? Are your parents bigots, as well?"
@WhitestRabbit_ I KNOW I would. Don't act like you know me better than I know myself. Your post is ignorant. Doesn't matter who posts it.
@WhitestRabbit_ Yes.
@WhitestRabbit_ how fucking ignorant are you??
