@sadnthirsty BUT i saw the line an hour&amp;a half-ish before doors opened; there was a small# of ppl so I say be there at least 1hr in advance
@sadnthirsty bc i was on the 21+over side of the venue &amp; the underaged ppl who got there earlier had to be in another area
@sadnthirsty i was actually not early at all this was kind of a miracle HAHAHA but part of it prolly has to do with me being really short &amp;&amp;

@solrendis HOPEFULLY it doesnt come to that but yeah who fucking knows at this point
@solrendis they introduce her in a way that makes sense and she is super badass and i want to watch it again now :--)
@solrendis do it honestly and WW those two are the highlights for me and i love how they did WW i was worried she'd just pop up one time but
@solrendis i'm high key obsessed with his character i havent been this into a superhero character since wanda maximoff so u know its intense
@solrendis it definitely took a certain scene to make me for sure side with bats bc of reasons but ya affleck did...the best job...
@solrendis like ok actually yea his fight scenes i would say are better than the majority of superhero movies rn
@solrendis and his fight scenes are the most badass i've seen in a long time
@solrendis even if you don't agree i still would rec you watch it because i think he's such an interesting character
@solrendis that there are darker things about him that are not totally unjustified in him now killing people
@solrendis and its kind of like...he kind of hints at it during different parts of the movie either verbally or you can tell from his face
@solrendis ehhh i understand that definitely but i guess my take on that is this isnt the kind of batman you see very often
@solrendis i feel like i'm the only one who thoroughly enjoyed bvs and tbh i just dont get the ss appeal so i just dont expect anything tbh
@solrendis i hate you
@basile_orri MY FAV MOVIE
