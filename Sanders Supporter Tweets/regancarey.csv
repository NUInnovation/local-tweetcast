@PhilBryantMS @PatMcCroryNC PS Illinois has had the worst record with governors and they STILL wouldn't sign these bills. How sad is that?
@PhilBryantMS is now joining @PatMcCroryNC as part of the shameful piece of US history.
@xnslrzn Have you checked since Amnesty Day? Mine were erased!
"When you have no fines on your library card, the world becomes so much brighter"
@PatMcCroryNC how does it feel to be the villain in history books? #translivesmatter #dontdiscriminate
@theskimm 1st u send me the same email 5 times every morning all week then u show bias and lack of facts RE: @BernieSanders #annoyed

"@ShoeBirth sigh, it's sad"
@ShoeBirth nice catching up with you
Cannot get over the amazing #GoogleDoodle today.
"Me: Did you just throw my phone at me?
@ianinillinois : ...I was just giving it to you. 

He threw my phone at me."
Is no one going to tell #LAKings fans that it's Darling in the net tonight? #CHIvsLAK
Trying to justify the amount of sunglasses I have to my dad gets harder and harder with every purchase.
"See how easy it is to not call immigrants ""illegals""?"
LOL @ all the candidates quoting Bernie or paraphrasing him when their time comes. #Cute
Fuck yeah @BernieSanders!
Sen. Webb is annoying AF
One can never own too many @BernieSanders shirts.
@BillNye is a goddamn national treasure.
@xnslrzn I was at a Walgreens in New Orleans and she was standing in front of me at the register
YES VIOLA
Shame on you House of Representatives.
"I don't care what else happens, I just saw Jessica Lange"

@CaliKasten yes pleaaaase
@CaliKasten Moose looks more and more like the cat from sailor moon every day. I want cuddles with both of you.
"No Facebook, not interested in sharing the horrible memory of putting my cat down with people again. But thanks. http://t.co/2KrplvBpGl"
I'd like some data on how often sword fights really happened.
I am just so into the @CNN series The Seventies. I wish we could start in the 1770s and work our way up!
@MehdiWorldPeace sometimes you're too funny for me
"There's nothing like singing 'No Scrubs' at karaoke after a drunk guy hits on you. Sweet, swift justice."
@MehdiWorldPeace  mainly that people don't really get what happened in the story and think it's romantic in some way

Trying to get these rally tickets is like trying to sign up for classes freshman year.
@_Epershand suddenly a big Hawks fan? ðŸ˜‰
I LOVE YOU BEARDED BABIES
Holy shit
"Puck yes, God bless"
IM ALREADY GETTING YELLED AT ABOUT READING AHEAD IN BOOK CLUB BUT THE BOOK ISNT OUT YET
I think the boys need some espresso or something

""Okay. Come on asswipes!"""
COME ON
"You beautiful silly Lego of a man, I just love you."
"Just be cool, Crawford. Don't do anything I wouldn't do."
I hope I never make my dad feel the way the Hawks do when they have a breakaway and don't score.
So much joy in this apartment right now
@grantmyatt I was going to text you!
@isabelbieri I do!
"Fuck yes, God bless, #onegoal"
Lucky to have a sister that's as into cats as me.
SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP
You've got to be kidding me.
But... I don't like this.
There are no words.
GOD BLESS
I think most Saturday's should be dedicated to screen printing and watching dateline with @ianhilton1
Every time I go to work another person tells me that I'm so quiet that they didn't know I was there. Maybe I should randomly scream?
"My boss: ""Oh, wait, you're like... A real full on hippie? I mean I always knew you were... I just didn't realize... Wow."""
"""If we print the file as is it's going to be impossible to read.""
""Yeah, I want it to be impossible.""
""Oh...""
""It's an art school thing."""

@ShoeBirth I hate it
@ShoeBirth this is so wrong
@colin_gargano I think the answer is yes.
"""Yes um can I buy 8 limes please?""
""This is a 7/11.""
""Yes.""
