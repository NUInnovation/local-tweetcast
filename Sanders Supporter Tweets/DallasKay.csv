"So many MCM's yet their mans DM is full of ""just friends""."
Saddening to see so many beautiful women with men who will never appreciate their worth.

Patience is a virtue.
It just says a lot about them when they're not frustrated by a child who doesn't understand or a friend thats had a little too much to drink
I find patience to be one of the most attractive traits in a man.
