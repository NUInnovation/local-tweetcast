@cjgarcia4 :(
@twimc_label @_iamamiwhoami_ that underwater scene is still one of the most stunning things you guys have created &lt;3
@cjgarcia4 https://t.co/gDzHcQJ3oE
@jk_rowling @RGalbraith Should we be expecting another Strike book this year? Just finished CoE and dying for the next!! Love this series :)
@mametown this is too real 😞
@BryanFuller @AmericanGodsSTZ @andmichaelgreen @neilhimself @DAVID_A_SLADE Love her!!!
@netflix do me a solid and bring Thomas Newman back to score #ASeriesofUnfortunateEvents :)
@mametown so like a low budget wife swap
This is so undeserving
WHAT @ THE OSCARS EXPLAIN
@TheDoctorLuke The victim always denies it ever happened. Madonna's doing the same thing right now with Sean Penn. Backtracking. Denying.
@cjgarcia4 @ me next time 👌🏼
@thexfiles Founder's Mutation instantly proved that this show still deserves to be on the air. Such a good episode!!
@kyleisnotarobot :(
@kyleisnotarobot are you talking about TIHTY cause I'm still bitter about it
@toriamos could a Scarlet's Walk vinyl be reality someday? :) https://t.co/hVt3LJEW4s
@cjgarcia4 what's that
@TheLeftoversHBO absolutely phenomenal. One of the most stunning seasons of television I've seen. @HBO better back a third season!
@cjgarcia4 this sounds like a conspiracy????
Damn @TheLeftoversHBO knows how to keep me on my toes this season 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
@cjgarcia4 Chanel #3 in denial
@bearmccreary loved that last track in tonight's episode :) #twd
@BuzzFeed https://t.co/gVUXn9X9sh

@hodgesmusic it's never too late to change your mind about that
@imogenheap have you heard of the Seaboard Grand? It's incredible tech and seems like it'd be just up your alley!  https://t.co/eEk9pkQV2d

@thenickandonly what were you interviewing for 👀
@thenickandonly ok but how would you valid question
@thenickandonly @FlawlessAKG which song tho...
@kyleisnotarobot it was amazing
"@thenickandonly No, Coven is the worst season IMO."
@thenickandonly are these the early demo lyrics to Britney Spears' Hold It Against Me
@thenickandonly @FlawlessAKG because you love yourself
@imogenheap this new instrument has you written all over it http://t.co/Pk50kHF41m

@thenickandonly #truthbomb
@thenickandonly you have strange taste
@kyleisnotarobot christmas?
@KyledAldrich THAT'S MY FAVORITE OF ALL THE FINALES!!
@wowpatricia tweet of the millenium
@kathleenakelly rude as hell
@AnnaKendrick47 does the breakfast club actually make you cry though #pitchperfectquestions
@kathleenakelly don't do it
@oheyaustin http://t.co/l3OhjFom0a
@thenickandonly ROSAMUND PIKE'S PERFORMANCE
@kathleenakelly what're you getting??
@KyledAldrich @kathleenakelly Ms. Sackhoff (Kara Thrace) is a Portlander! She was in Powells the other day..
@kathleenakelly @KyledAldrich it was part of what convinced me to watch BSG in the first place... now I've discovered it was all a sham.
@KyledAldrich @kathleenakelly Yep!! That's what you referenced :)
@KyledAldrich @kathleenakelly EPISODE 6???? That's the episode I tell everyone you get hooked at. That's where I got hooked at..
@kathleenakelly @KyledAldrich It wasn't actually!! It was from the first episode after the miniseries - 33 :)
"@KyledAldrich @kathleenakelly Okay, thesaurus. What episode are you on?"
@KyledAldrich you used it as a reference during scriptwriting long ago for sheer excellence... I thought...you'd watched it already?
@Arturo52311 @thenickandonly I'm very well aware he produced those. His work on Born This Way was fantastic! His work on ARTPOP though..
@kyleisnotarobot @thenickandonly @Arturo52311 I mean I'm with Kyle on this one..
@kyleisnotarobot FINALLY
@thenickandonly chinese fire drills
"@thenickandonly 7. Solid pop record, but nothing groundbreaking or innovative."
@kyleisnotarobot listening to underneath the tree like http://t.co/BuUuOsW9pV
@thenickandonly http://t.co/dm7cTPdJXb tbh
@thenickandonly wow okay
@thenickandonly which is so sad :( I wish albums sold well all the time!
@thenickandonly 1989 sold 600k in 24 hours omg
@thenickandonly Did you listen to the deluxe? It's one of the deluxe tracks along with Wonderland and New Romantics.
@thenickandonly I found You Are In Love to be one of the most romantic songs I've heard in a while. Makes me tear up when I hear it :(
"@thenickandonly Style and You Are In Love wowed me! I think the album is great, but I get what you're sayin'"
"@thenickandonly this is the most ""dad tweet"" I've ever read"
@brend_android http://t.co/Fqa9HrSdB1
#TurnipForWhat
@kyleisnotarobot was it me was I in it
"@thenickandonly It comes out in the US on Tuesday, but it's been released already in other places, so it's out there to listen! :)"
@thenickandonly you should listen to Betty Who's debut album :)
@KyledAldrich that finale is one of my favorite episodes of television.. It's insane
@mametown beanz has a twin https://t.co/gtyueOdDvu

"@thenickandonly Oh also, the song Sugar.. I could've sworn it was a Katy Perry reject."
@thenickandonly V &gt; Overexposed. Some good tracks but overall forgettable.. Worth a listen I suppose.
