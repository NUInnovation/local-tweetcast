@SenSanders definitely got that pre-teen vote! https://t.co/kVtWBcg8mw
"@cenkuygur media should definitely start introducing/reporting on @realDonaldTrump as ""Alleged Billionaire Donald Trump"""
@jpjanson @3075John I agree @ProgressOnline Is definitiely an entryist faction of tory saboteurs in the labour party as was Blair
@idwarp also the fact that when emails released 22 docs couldnt be because were SAP confidential proves that info mishandled
"@idwarp As one of the 10 ppl who can classify, post-classification is irrelevant as she should already know it can be deemed confidential"
@idwarp and ignorance of a rule of law is never an acceptable defense of a crime anyway. One way or the other she should be in trouble here.
"@idwarp on the subject of intent though, hillary is one of 10 ppl in US who is able to classify a document so should know better anyway"
@cenkuygur the need to show intent in hillary's email investigation is incorrect. Just the fact that its been mishandled is enough.
#NeverTrustAnyoneWho Runs for POTUS and makes claims they'll fix wall st while taking huge sums of money from them in paid speeches.
"@JoeSmithSDK That was always the problem with Clintons. When Bill was prez his new democrats pulled the party to the right,"
@tomcopley Thats a sexy mayor

@HamillHimself When you are next over in the UK will you please please please consider going on to @CelebJuice ? #AskMrHamill
Anyone else ever been too depressed to sleep?
@Nixadoodle He released his tax returns though. Why does this need to be sent to the male candidate? Nothing in that letter applies to B.S
@ThePlumLineGS the prob is she can be seen lying so often that nothing she says can actually be trusted anymore so wont be taken seriously
I feel sorry for America and the shit choice between Clinton/Trump . I think this is the end of american dominance of the globe
@RichardWS @OliverWest100 @TrueBlueSue1 I suppose someone needs to suck bills dick! I cant imagine hes good for much else!
@AnaKasparian has @jiadarola conceded that Donald Trump is in fact dominating the republican primaries yet? #tytlive

If they don't have one yet I suggest

Clitor Ale"
"@idwarp @PrincessLib_TYT @suddeneternity im guessing this beer is going to bring a new meaning to the phrase ""this tastes like piss"""
The answer is definitely not a chance in hell she can win by a landslide against Trump... #tytlive  https://t.co/KDMeDxZspG
"@davidfrum @TheAtlantic HAHAHA you are nuts.. This is guna be a really close election.. No chance of a landslide, she is too known."

@AbiWilks You're feeling pretty cactus about that?
@JohnEdwards33 Do you think Labour could've done better in Scotland if Kezia wasnt a Blairite and hadnt distanced Scottish Lab. from Corbyn?
@JohnEdwards33 How do you think Labour have faired in the elections?
@Juicexlx Im going with Sir Liesalot
Lynton Crosby has been knighted for his service to politics! So racism &amp; fraud being awarded. They should call him #SirLiesalot
All through #bbcqt all i could think was that Isabel Oakeshott looks like a woman who loves anal.
@TiaKinay Also Kezia is a Blairite.. If anything all this proves is that neo-liberal politics are disastrous in progressive left wing areas
John Kasich has dropped out of the GOP Race. Trump actually won! This is going to be entertaining... in a slapstick somebody gets hurt sense
Trump is doing a better job pandering to @SenSanders supporters than @HillaryClinton is! #FeelTheBern #ImWithHer https://t.co/pPexdAOw2e
@MJWhiteley @twitter I still assume the gov will attempt it at least..
@MJWhiteley @twitter I have no idea... feels like it sometimes though. Its like if something bad about gov trending just disappears.
Go to https://t.co/lrfC8TMg2A to see twitter trends and guess what time @twitter got called and told to censor #toryelectionfraud
So Trump has all but won the republican nomination now... What if he goes on to win the general election? #WhisperOfANightmare #tytlive
If that happens we can all start calling @JohnMannMP The Racistfinder General  https://t.co/8jJpM7rloB
@RomanChoPhoto I agree delivery was off a bit but i think it fell flat in the room because he was throwing harsh truth bombs on them
"@jonathas Have you read Naz Shah's apology? What do you think of it? 

How has Ken shown he doesn't care?"
@lucyallan In fact to make such a claim as this is at best disingenuous and at worst a bold faced lie.. You are a disgrace to democracy.
@lucyallan Not true.. if anything public are backing JR Dr's even more... As can be seen increasing in every poll/survey since Jan.
