@pinko_snob It's from Firefly. It's Mr. Universe. You can't stop the signal. https://t.co/t0aTjdYcTi
@b_mullaney @zachhaller You said Hillary was at 30-32% favorables? Maybe I misunderstood.
"@LeeCamp @abowersock Welcome to the machine, brothers and sisters! Our republic has been flushed as well."
"@bait51 Nothing, far as I know. They certified it despite all of the things that were wrong, despite a lot of anger from voters."
"@bait51 @burnodo In NYC, yeah."
@Landorcan @Deir_in_DC @JL00t It's a function of Twitter. It's a very distracting medium. Sometimes I think that's a feature.
@TheBpDShow Anybody who can watch this video and still claim Hillary is POC candidate is in deep denial: https://t.co/p66wyCms2r
@TheBpDShow Some kind of Rainbow Warrior Civil Rights Champion. This is all lies. Only question why so many POC are going along w/it.
"That's b/c it's not real. Look, Hillary was on the wrong side of the race war 8 yrs ago, and now selling herself as  https://t.co/HvsFZVrxw9"

"@bait51 No, the Maricopa Cty Recorder (sup of elections) in AZ said that election fraud had happened. Voter reg info hacked/altered."
@OnTheLeft580 @NewyorkWeissman @Libertea2012 @HillaryClinton I am so done w/the Dems. Holy shit.
@OnTheLeft580 @NewyorkWeissman @Libertea2012 @HillaryClinton Oh my God. I could stand watching about ten seconds of that.
"@WorldForBernie @Zacherydtaylor @twitter  @JeanetteJing  @Women4Bernie @People4Bernie @rosariodawson  Really fucking classy, Twitter."
"@scout_lisa @JeanetteJing @twitter @Support Reinstate her, Twitter. Suppressing political speech is not attractive."
@StoneSculptorJN @NewyorkWeissman @JeanetteJing What the hell happened?
@TheBpDShow Redefining basic human needs as something you can only have if privileged is a Master's tools kind of argument.
"@TheBpDShow If we redefine it as a privilege, aren't we like ppl who say making minimum wage is privilege b/c ppl in Asia working for less?"
@TheBpDShow But isn't that a basic *right* that's being taken away from AAs?
"@TheBpDShow Like, the idea is, if I can walk to the store and get a Snapple without getting shot, that's white privilege."
@TheBpDShow Thank you for saying this. There's a disturbing replacement of idea of human rights w/privilege.
@TheBpDShow I think this is a good article on them. https://t.co/8re24vkTOM
"@SansaRising @Iowa4Bernie FL is Hillary/Trump country, mainly. Old ppl, corrupt electoral system, closed primaries."

"@BarbaraLNewsome Yeah, our incredibly unpopular Congress thinks our incredibly unpopular frontrunner is JUST GREAT!"
@CKHyppolite Ugh!
"@katie15price Hey, Katie, what's this referendum?"
@AnnieF571 @adam01time @BernieSanders That's correct. But Adam has a pt that talking Trump has its definite downside.
"@dkmich @wordpressdotcom That old American classic:  Work harder! If something goes wrong, you didn't work hard enough!"
"@dkmich @wordpressdotcom ""We just have to have a REALLY big turnout"" is what these ppl tend to say in response to the problem."
@dkmich @wordpressdotcom The weirdest attitude toward election fraud I've ever seen--sort of a turn-up-the-hands-hey-what-can-ya-do look
@dkmich @wordpressdotcom It's like country is divided into those who think all elections/voting are shit--and those who have
@dkmich @wordpressdotcom I've yet to find many ppl who can look at things electorally--and also outside of that box. It's so important--
@dkmich @wordpressdotcom Voting for Sanders doesn't give him Clinton. He's wrong about that. Election fraud gives him Clinton.
@dkmich @wordpressdotcom As well as for Trump.
"@dkmich @wordpressdotcom But county by county, where life expectancy is dropping, ppl are also voting for Sanders."
@dkmich @wordpressdotcom or need them. Someday it won’t want you either.
@dkmich @wordpressdotcom This is the part that's absolutely spot-on: The world of self-driving cars and global outsourcing doesn’t want
"@dkmich @wordpressdotcom As long as same corrupt bastards in charge, no idea will be good enough."
@dkmich @wordpressdotcom It's not the ideas for how to fix it we lack. We have most of the ideas we need. It's a power problem.
"@dkmich @wordpressdotcom Actually, if Sanders won, I think, in time, some of this could be dealt with. It's not like solutions are difficult"
"@dkmich @wordpressdotcom Although if some of the overdose deaths are actually suicides, that brings the South up. Lots of OD here."
@dkmich @wordpressdotcom Much worse than in the South or the NE.
"@dkmich @wordpressdotcom Jesus, what's happening out West? The mountain states and the SW have brutal numbers."
@dkmich @wordpressdotcom Oh. Shame on me for judging by the blurb. Will read.
@Samasiam @IBTimesUK I know. I was thinking same thing. It's all looking a lot like organized crime these days.
"@adam01time @BernieSanders No, he really hasn't. That part, you don't need to be mad about. You're rt about giving Trump air time though."
@adam01time @BernieSanders True. Good point.
"@bait51 Yeah, I'm not sure about upstate, but I'm damned sure about the city. WTF!"
"@bait51 Given that nothing happens when ppl outright admit there was fraud, as in AZ, don't think they're concerned much w/hiding it."
"@Deir_in_DC @JL00t So much so the MSM is getting nasty about it. Saw an article yesterday that was very insulting toward ""die-hards"""
@Deir_in_DC @RedwoodGirl You're right about that.
"@Deir_in_DC @RedwoodGirl There were definite barbs launched at Hillary. 3 am phone call ad, for instance. And ""Trudge up the Hill!"""
"@Deir_in_DC @RedwoodGirl That was annoying. Did happen after he said a remarkable number of true things at WHCD, though."
"@WeLoveBernie16 @HillaryClinton At this pt, I wouldn't put anything past them."
"@RedwoodGirl @christreadway 1% trying to drive us out of the cities, or just plain greed?"
"@b_mullaney @zachhaller Where are you getting that? HuffPost has her at 41%, RealClear at 39% Alternet at 36%."
@b_mullaney @zachhaller Didn't expect that so soon.
@b_mullaney @zachhaller OMG Seriously?
@JL00t @Deir_in_DC Then they'll throw Biden at us and expect us to be so grateful it's not her we fall in line.
@SusanSarandon We need this for all fifty states.
@OperationOppo Yet somehow being attacked by Republicans counts for something. Whatever.
@christreadway @RedwoodGirl It is a problem when people can't afford to live w/in commuting distance of yr goddamned chi-chi restaurants.
"@devinedianakins I don't know I think it's better WITH the typo! Falsely neural, LOL."
@BernieVolunteer @ABC When they're NOT meaningless for places like Eastern Europe.
"@BernieVolunteer @ABC OK. This is fucked up, and I don't want to hear more garbage about how exit polls are meaningless."
@WeLoveBernie16 @HillaryClinton Like we haven't seen that coming for about 3 months.
@Bill_Cimbrelo Another AMAZING SURPRISE!
"@ggreenwald Boy do I feel their pain. We're having a kind of ""jamas"" moment up here too. Bleah!"
"@dkmich @BernieVolunteer Oh, I bet she's doing it for Sheila Dixon. Either that or b/c she has a grudge vs somebody in Balt machine."
@dkmich @BernieVolunteer Something really weird is going on. Or maybe it's too egregious for the MD machine to go along with?
@dkmich @BernieVolunteer This is crazy. It's like imagining Karl Rove investigating a slander case.
"@devinedianakins Diana, that was a very funny typo. Pundits indeed are falsely represented as neural. :-)"
@dkmich @BernieVolunteer In fact was the main proponent of creating incredibly insecure online voting for MD.
@dkmich @BernieVolunteer Wait a damned minute. *Linda Lamone* ordered this? Linda Lamone is horribly corrupt and has been opposed...
"@zachhaller I love it, myself."
"@adam01time @BernieSanders Sanders campaign trying to kneecap that ""justification"" for voting for Clinton by saying her chances aren't good."
@adam01time @BernieSanders Her main argument for voting for her is that she will prevent Trump from going to WH. He's her boogeyman.
@adam01time @BernieSanders Most ppl already think Clinton is shit. They won't vote for her b/c they like her or think she'd be good Prez.
"@adam01time @BernieSanders They *are* battling Hillary, I believe. But you may not agree w/their choice of tactics. Here's the thing:"
"@adam01time @BernieSanders Still, I keep my eyes open for evidence one way or another. Collusion is a possibility here."
@adam01time @BernieSanders Some juicy deal through the Clinton Foundation--but I admit I could be totally wrong about that.
@adam01time @BernieSanders I still think Trump is actually just doing a wrestling promo as heel to Hillary's face--prob in exchange for
"@Deir_in_DC @RedwoodGirl But we all know what he really thinks of Hillary, because we watched the WHCD."
@adam01time @BernieSanders Her talking pt is BS b/c she's pretty much ass vs Trump.
@adam01time @BernieSanders I get it. What they're trying to do is de-fang one of Hill's two talking points: Vote for me b/c OMG Trump!
"@poligirl Fuck, fuck, I hate this."
"@adam01time @BernieSanders It's not the people who are the problem here, IMO."
@adam01time @BernieSanders The people know she's crap. That's why the polls keep getting worse for her the longer she talks.
"@adam01time @BernieSanders We're up against not only a campaign contest, but voter purges and election fraud. The corruption is *deep*."
"@mmgood716 @onecaliberal See, you're forced to choose a form of the destructor and then this comes at you: https://t.co/sILrzxDflj"
@adam01time @BernieSanders What do you not care about? The fact that Sanders outdoes Clinton when up against Trump?
"@mmgood716 @onecaliberal Sort of like Gozer the Gozerian. Very powerful, but ridiculous at the same time: https://t.co/H37KAv17WP"
