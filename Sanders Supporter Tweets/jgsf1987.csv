"@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia While it's true that DT's family has ties to KKK, the problem is that it won't stick when HC highlights it."
"@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia Now, I realize I only touched the surface in terms of DT &amp; women/poc/youth, I and so I'll do that right now."
"@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia Both DT &amp; HC represent the establishment in different ways. DT as donor, HC as political insider."
"Hey all, let's make this go viral. #BernieStrong #FeelTheBern #HillNever #DropOutHillary https://t.co/BlTMDowq3G"
"@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia @GreenPartyUS This is 100% true, which is why we need to keep on fighting regardless of who tries to silence us."
"@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia @GreenPartyUS I'm going to keep saying that, as it should be a wake-up call to all if us. 2 sides of same coin."
"@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia Again I'm down to backing him if he goes 3rd party/indie route. But as I said before, it's highly unlikely."
"@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia If BS, no question would COTUS go blue. Again it's the issue of trust. BS's record proves he's earned it."
"@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia Plausible, though highly unlikely. Independents likely won't grant her that if she's elected from their distrust."
"@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia That means a return to Jim Crow, but this time legislated at Federal level. It's not lost on me that GOP wants it"
@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia @GreenPartyUS This means that Repubs are in control for new apportionment &amp; new federal regulations for voting.
"@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia Even if we throw our vote to @GreenPartyUS, the end result is 3-branch united government under GOP."
"@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia @GreenPartyUS That's possible that we could take HC out in 2020 primaries, but it's highly unlikely."
"@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia And who will pay the price for the lack of progress in 2020? It'd be HC, as the bucks stops with her as POTUS."
"@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia I can assure you that if HC is POTUS, GOP Congress won't budge &amp; won't pay any price for intransigence in 2018."
@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia The fact is that it will be difficult to get someone on SCOTUS regardless if HC is in WH. GOP controls Congress.
"@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia I agree, but look at it this way. Even if HC wins in 2016, she'll lose in 2020. Where will that leave us?"
@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia Which is something that's silenced by DT &amp; to a worse degree HC. She's got paid trolls to silence any dissent.
"@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia I'm aware, but this is about more than just the platform or Bernie himself. It's about giving people a voice."
"@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia That's true to a degree, since no one really follows it. Still, it'd signal that Dem Establishment's listening."
"@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia Think about it, Repubs if voted in power in 2016 w DT, would possibly lose Congress in 2018 midterm &amp; WH in 2020."
"@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia That's true. We'd nail all angles with BS in WH. As for minority/women's rights, we can hold DT in check in 2018."
@AmerLiberal @Hekateenodia I'm not so sure BS will endorse HC as I'm pretty sure the platform committee would just reject all his proposals.
