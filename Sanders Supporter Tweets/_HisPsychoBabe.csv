In other news I hate smoking with chapped lips but I'm too lazy to get my Chapstick üôÉ
they should just answer questions like that'd help a fuck ton
"And honestly do you know how many situations would calm down if cops just answered questions? Like stop saying ""just listen to cops"" maybe"
Gods and are society really needs to take them off this pedestal
And like no not every cop is bad but not every cop is good hell I know some cops that are fucking assholes like they're everyday people not
To be in defense mode like I have rights and I have the right to know why you need my ID or why I'm being arrested
"I'm so tired of this ""listen to officers"" movement like...no if I'm doing nothing wrong or they can't tell me why I'm in trouble I'm going"
I'm gonna fail this final with class üíÅüèø

@TaylorDukelow @EndangeredLove_ or since we're the younger generation we're just too sensitive now days

@TaylorDukelow probably for attention
@TaylorDukelow exactly it's like your lungs are just filled with fire and you just don't want to breathe anymore
@TaylorDukelow why not be emotionally numb while also feel everything at once for awhile? It's like the best thing ever
"I very much would wake up everyday and say ""okay let's be normal today"" but no it doesn't work like that"
"Constantly fight with the demons telling me to just kill myself just for the fuck of it"" like if I could choose to not be a fucked up person"
"Or ""hey a panic attack sounds like a super fun thing to do today"" or ""why not cry for some unknown reason, push away everyone I love, and"
"I don't know what people think depression is but I promise you I don't wake up and just say ""I want to be painfully just fucked up today"""
