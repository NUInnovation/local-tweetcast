@Jasmine_Dhillon this one too😂😂 wtf
@Jasmine_Dhillon I'm a little more awake now and this tweet is horribly wrong😅
Fmlfmlfffflllll
I can't be on the fricken class right now. I'm too tied and I'm felling asleep😭😭😭😭😭
Idk how I'm going to be able to get to my 8am class next quarter
"Not only is my class early tomorrow, but I have to wake up even earlier to wash my hair &amp; I'm sleeping late cause of my research paper😀"
You bet I'm tweeting Drake lyrics😂
"""All my 'let's just be friends' are friends I don't have anymore. How do you not check on me when things go wrong?"""
I swear I'm the only person that doesn't watch game of thrones
It's already May😳
My whole life has been a lie😂😅
"All I want to do is fall asleep cause I'm sooooo tired, but I swear it's because I have a shit ton of hw I don't want to do😅"
My ongoing dilemma: Am I really tired or is this just another way I'm procrastinating?
My brain is running a thousand miles a minute. It's hard to put it all down.
5 page research paper with 10 references due on the 2nd and I'm still procrastinating🙌🏽
Who is going to fail their test tomorrow?!🙋🏽
I will never understand how people will let their friends read their stories. I could never do that. I guess I'm too shy or embarrassed? Idk
"Drake dropped that new new! Ready for some new music. If you know me, you know I already copped that shit😂"
I'm so screwed this quarter
Students should not be graded on participation
I always tend to give myself a lower grade so I feel better about myself when I actually get it back😂 I'm so lame
I always count how many points I think I'll lose on my exams before turning them in😂 Just so I'm not surprised when I get them back
🙏🏽 https://t.co/VKaiopfEcz
Studying 3 hours before my exam👏🏽🙌🏽😀
I need to stop buying books
Officially have 13 books on my shelf that I need to read and I'm still currently reading All The Light We Cannot See.
Idky I do this to myself
Finished a whole book today instead of studying and doing my hw which will be impossible to do since I'm busy the whole weekend😀
"""I would like a double mocha shoot me with sweet whip"" 😂😂😂😂😭"
"I voted for the first time because, for once, I actually like a candidate enough to do so. #BeHeard https://t.co/G4ipREksGL"
I haven't looked yet and I'm already freaking out https://t.co/67OHv9SB7j
I almost fall asleep in this class every time I have it. I have senioritis and I'm not even a senior😭
Why is it that I get sleepy when I think about doing hw and not when I read or text? Wtf is my life.
29hrs in total.
This is how I will die. The fair will be the death of me.
Nothing bothers me more than people saying they can't see a POC play a certain role in a film or tv show.
"Or people who complain about being 'alone'. Who gaf if you're alone? If your life revolves around happiness because of people, that sucks."
Especially if they put themselves in a situation that makes them feel sorry for themselves.
Nothing annoys me more than someone who feels sorry for themselves.

Kobe's final game was amazing. They won. I'm emotional.

"It was just weird to see how I don't even talk to this person anymore😂 And I use to care so much, now I don't ga-flying-f😂😭"
"Saw a ""do you know (name)"" on Facebook and it was one of my old friends (last person I ever considered a 'best' friend). IT WAS SO WIERD!"
That is so sad!
The generations coming won't know the great impact Harry Potter had😱 Most of them will only know about the Hunger Games
Who didn't go to school cause they were gonna study for their test and decided not to study and is gonna fail their test tomorrow?!🙋🏽🙋🏽
It is now 2am and I think I should stop😅
"Me at 10pm: I'll watch one more episode.
*gets interesting af*
Me: Oh... One more!
*ends on cliffhanger*
Me: Just one more!"
...about the assignment😒🙄
...read them. Im so heated😅 I did all the work &amp; everyone else probably got a better grade just cause they looked like they were talking...
There were only three of us that did anything and I had to reread the damn article &amp; rewrite the notes &amp; then type them so everyone could...
"How tf does she know I was talking to my group if I was all the way across the room, &amp; had my back facing her? Total bs"
I don't believe in teachers gracing 'in class participation'. So stupid.
"But I do have family, and I know for a fact they will always have my back, take a shot for me, cause hell, I would do the same for them."
"Which I have no problem with. I never had a friend who I felt like would stand up for me anyway, so I don't regret the people who I 'lost'."
...friend. It's just sad to see how easily (western society) people can throw away friends like they're nothing when they get 'new' ones.
"I was always taught to stand up for your friends, and I've always had, it's just in our culture. My dad almost gave his life to safe his..."
"""...those who break the rules are scum, that's true, but those who abandon their friends are worse than scum."""
Wow. This; it explains it all. I got a little emotional. #FeelTheBern https://t.co/JFUhmjnj4i
do I need to avoid Twitter like the plague since I'm behind in Arrow?! Don't tweet about that shit!😭
"This teacher. WTF. I told her I forgot to put the damn reference at the end and she goes ""well, ok.""
I hate school so much"
Shhhhiiitttttt... I forgot to put my reference at the end of my damn paper. It's dumb how we have to reference an article we're summarizing😒
It's HILARIOUS how much my mom and I bicker. It's because we're practically the same person; we both hate being wrong😂
Until she sees that my stacks of books has increased.... BUT that would take longer for her to process
"The reason is, my mom is gonna find out if I order them, but if I buy them sneakily and smuggle them in my home, she will never know😂"
Why tf are books so expensive at physical bookstores?! Sometimes I need to buy some books without using a damn credit/debit card😒
Look who is being a responsible adult and sleeping at 11pm. I'm actually tired. God bless🙌🏽
"When I start doing my hw, I automatically feel tired af."
"I love when people come to me for book, movie and tv show recommendations😂 it's such an honor💁🏽"
I almost fell off my chair while falling asleep in class
@HiCinthia I felt so out of place when I moved here &amp; many people here don't even talk about inequality-- It's like it doesn't exist😒
@HiCinthia UGH! RIGHT?! I didn't go to prom cause it's expensive af and people here act like its the end of the world.
"""A whole nation has him to thank for independence"" (continues to praise Gandhi).
*sitting &amp; reading while wanting to gauge my eyeballs out*"
Why. Why is it that when I sleep before 1am I wake up super early? Who wakes up at 6am on a Sunday?!
But I caved today. I haven't had pho in foreevvssss
"*in my head* ""It's cause I promised myself I would spend less money on food and use the money I saved on books"""
"This dude at the pho place literally said ""long time no see""😂 I came here way too much lol"
"Sadly, the headphones couldn't be black😒"
Now me and Buttercup can be badasses together and beat some bad guy butt👊🏽! 😂
We're in the time where you can 'powerpuff girl' yourself. My childhood dreams have come true. The future is now. https://t.co/4WjmH7XZ68
Can it be April 23rd already?
We were too busy gawking at this dude and his appearance that we were lost for another extra hour. LOL
"And it was SO dumb cause we got lost, again, and I was like ""did you listen to what he said?"" &amp; my friend was like ""no"" 😂😂😭"
Every time I pass the air force base I remember getting lost &amp; asking this really good looking guy which way to go. I didn't listen at all😂
"And if I get another balayage, that will be expensive af. Why is getting your hair cut so expensive?!"
"I want to cut it, but then I don't cause that means a lot of the color I have will be cut off."
My hair has gotten so long!
"I actually got someone to read Red Rising! I'm so proud of myself, and happy someone listened to my recommendation😂 https://t.co/KYxDg1VcPv"
I have class on Fridays now😭 I would have been done for the week😢
Film classes should only be 1 1/2hrs (on lecture days). 2 1/2hrs is waaaay too long to keep me concentrated
I donated to a presidential candidate for the first time! A lot of firsts are coming from me during these elections💁🏽
"""And by the time the sun rises, this cock-a-doodle will do"" 😂😂😭"
And guess who isn't going?!🙋🏽
"Will Friedle, Pierce Brown, Dante Basco, Elden Henson, James &amp; Oliver Phelps, Danielle Panabaker, Robbie Amell &amp; so many more at the ECCC😭"
So happy I dropped that 8am class
Waking up at 9 is still too early for me😭
@Jasmine_Dhillon found the tweet!😂
"...not be afraid to do so. When I learned about the top 1%, looked more into poverty and the economy, I was shocked of how little I knew."
I tweeted about the top 1% a year ago and I talked to my friends about it. I'm glad a person like Bernie is able to tell the truth and...
Amazing https://t.co/U3YfFFXgum
"So apparently I've bought ""too many books"" (whatever that means) so I have to ""calm down"" and wait until August to buy more... LOL! NAH!"
Finished The Nightingale and I'm emotionally drained.
"""Come up with something original.""
-Ok! *writes something original*
""That's sooo cliché.""
-Actually, it's a true story, sooooooo...."
"But love in general isn't cliché. A strong willed woman lead isn't cliché. I'm so tired of the damn word ""cliché""😂"
"I don't believe in 'clichè' things when it comes to stories. Except maybe a guy running into a girl, drops her papers &amp; falling in love"
"I love the feeling when you're reading a book and listening to music, like you're separated from the world."
"Antoine, in The Nightingale, just ripped my heart out and threw it out the window."
"Pretty sure everyone has seen this, but I can't explain how much I LOVE this. https://t.co/ftme1P3r4m #ToneDownForWhat #Bernie2016"
Stupid tweet sent before I was done😅😂
#ToneDownForWhat
"Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev"
Sad how Gandhi is considered a 'mahatma' &amp; everyone (western society) thinks he's this amazing person &amp; know nothing about Bhagat Singh.
How this guy died in the book was THE WORST ever!!! And to imagine this actually happened to people in WWII.. I hate everything..
@rainbowrowell Bernie actually has a plan; where everyone else calls it a hoax/brushes it off. He has started many times it's a huge issue:)
"Straight up bhangra music tho, not that sad sappy stuff😂"
"When it's super nice out, you'll see me blasting Punjabi music🙌🏽"
It's time again to tweet about how I'm going to fall asleep in my classes. Like this one.
"They need to just stay away from each other. Like, YOUR HUSBAND IS A WAR PRISONER! UGH! 😂"
"Like DAMN! You a Nazi staying at her house, but y'all like each other, but y'all are married! It's frustrating!"
"I get so impatient with books sometimes that I skim through some pages to see if what I want will happen, just to get myself excited😅"
"These last few books I've read: 🙌🏽
Reading The Nightingale right now and I can't put it down!"
"Before #BernieMadeMeWhite and my friends/family white, they were labeled and stereotyped for the way they looked. https://t.co/qMA2ZpsDIS"
I still want to watch The Nice Guys so badly! I'm surprised trailers haven't come on TV for it
Bless up WA! We did it.
#WAcaucus my precinct was 12/12 for Bernie. It was 11/12 until one guy changed his mind to Bernie.
"Oh, and I'm a back up delegate. So that happened today😅"
Nothing is funnier than people in India trying to hit on girls or guys in comments on Instagram😂
I registered to vote just for Bernie and voted for the first time just for Bernie. #StandTogether #AFutureWeBelieveIn
#iCaucused FEEL THE BERN! #Bernie2016 #BirdieSanders
Truuuuuuu🙌🏽 https://t.co/J2zNVcD0Zl
Caucus 10am at ERHS today! I swear I'm gonna see no one I know there and my opinions on everyone will change😅😒
Even birds like Bernie https://t.co/TwFQEkEcr2
It's sad that my mom cares so much about what others think. Who gaf?
"Finished Six of Crows! It was so good! Oddly, all I have left to read is historical fiction😂😅"
One week for spring break is not even a break. It's not long enough😒
"Anyway, bless up."
That class was the worst. I took stats and got a 3.8 and this was just all over the place and one of the worst classes I ever took.
"At least I expected that I wouldn't get an amazing grade in the stupid, confusing af nonprofit financial class"
