"@DOUBTMYPROGRESS @kgarcia_sa TOTALLY different contexts buddy, don't conflate the two."
@kgarcia_sa the Campign has nothing to do with our # so stop referencing @BernieSanders This was born from Bronx natives themselves.
"@kgarcia_sa intentionality is vital. We are not here to throw a party, we are here to build a grassroots movement."
"@kgarcia_sa lastly, we believe the #bronx is still BURNING!"
@kgarcia_sa @BernieSanders campaign is no dystopic commercial rave.
@kgarcia_sa context is key.  @BernieSanders platform speaks volumes to the very issues that continue to plagued the Bronx.
