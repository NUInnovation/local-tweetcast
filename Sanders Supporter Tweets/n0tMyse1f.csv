"@BerniesHomie I'll add, my mom did eventually seek help and is now a decent person, but she wasn't fit for custody when I was coming up"
@BerniesHomie I say good. I grew up in a divorced home and got stuck with my financially poor and physically abusive mother. This seems fair
@n0tMyse1f Except with the personable dash of flair found #Nixon1968. It's almost like she's an insurgent Republican. Like she was planted.
