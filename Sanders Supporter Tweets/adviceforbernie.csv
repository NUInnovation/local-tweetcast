"@cenkuygur You've got a big brain:
If DT promised HC, ""I'll get the GOP nom, then quit in Oct,"" how would DNC act? 
https://t.co/a05VeBCxOZ"
"Proof that it's not over. Why would they care, if it's over? https://t.co/fPc35BthCv"
Yes I do. Here's looking at Leahy.  https://t.co/PIMxBqc7Cl
"What if Trump promised DNC/HC that if he actually got the GOP nom, he'd quit in Oct? Would they act any differently? https://t.co/a05VeBCxOZ"
Why doesn't the DNC rally behind Bernie to beat Trump? DT's a plant. Jeb's theory was treated as a joke. It's not. https://t.co/sL7tBOFh7g
"Just a reminder from January. Jeb Bush, no dummy, in a powerful and connected family, thinks Trump is a HC stooge.  https://t.co/RcAy0JfpqT"
"In this FB post, Jeb says he refuses to vote for DT or HC. Calls H untrustworthy. D a fake conservative. He's right. https://t.co/RT804COO0d"
"Look at what people *do,* not what they *say.* For whatever reason HC is IT. Trump promised to quit. Bernie is irrelevant in this scenario."
Bernie has messed with THE PLAN. That's why he is *ignored.* Completely. BS will not play ball like HC will. And DT was planning to ditch...
Is the DNC worried about Trump? Nope. The GOP? Nope. Obama? Nah. Why not? They know he's gonna quit. This election IS to crown HC. Done.
Imagine..if all the Powerful People *know* that DT will NOT be Prez because he promised to quit in Oct..THEN Bernie vs. Trump is irrelevant.
I can't see a single reason The Don couldn't just quit in Oct. People would be mad at him? So what? Does he care? He's friggin Donald Trump!
GOP obviously prefers HC to DT. Look at their Actions. They did nothing to stop DT. Jeb! Called it last year... DT guarantees a HC victory.
"Yes, it's a ""mad"" theory. BUT, like all good theories, it has the benefit of explaining all the available facts. It even explains the GOP..."

"DT *literally* owes nothing to nobody. Not to donors, not to voters. He's a reality show TV star. Not a public servant. He can quit tomorrow"
How will DT throw the race? EZ. He's a loose cannon. Wouldn't be surprised AT ALL if one day he just says he's quitting coz he's bored.
"Why isn't DT a real threat? Maybe DNC *know* that DT will lose due to...
1) Rigged voting, or
2) he'll throw the race, somehow."
