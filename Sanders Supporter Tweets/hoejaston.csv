and I have just been informed that tacos are for dinner and I believe that this has been my inner consciousness telling me something
you got up on the wrong side of the taco
not all tacos wear capes
every taco has a silver lining
don't cry over spilled tacos
taco got your tongue?
there are a lot of tacos in the sea
@hoejaston a picture is worth a thousand tacos
a taco is worth a thousand words
a taco a day keeps the doctor away
"sticks and stones may break my tacos, but words will never hurt me"
you can't teach an old taco new tricks
"when life gives you tacos, make tacos"
A Taco for a Taco makes the whole world hungry
wherefore art thou Taco?
I have a Taco
"and God said: ""Let there be tacos"""
We the Tacos
