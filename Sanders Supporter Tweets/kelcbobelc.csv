@justinradrian you asked me what she's lied about! How is that not what we are talking about?
@justinradrian she just lied in the #DemDebate saying she's been fighting for $15 all along when in reality it was $12. FYI I done replying
@justinradrian because you believe the lies! It's OK she doesn't know better

@MSNBC come on now delegates between @SenSanders and @HilaryClinton  405 and 595 it's a lot closer!
@Morning_Joe @MSNBC and yet you ended the show with saying she is most qualified! Now that's not so true is it?
@Morning_Joe stop saying @SenSanders isn't as qualified as she who will not be named! Do not discredit him!
