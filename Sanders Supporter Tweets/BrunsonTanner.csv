@JoshTheJourno literally the only reason I can see him going down that far. I remember at the beginning of season everyone said 1st round.
@JoshTheJourno very surprised by his downfall.
Really wanted the Rams to get Dhal and the German WR (can't spell it correctly) but both got taken.
"Love seeing Cook fall this far in the draft. Wasn't high on him at all. Low 5th, early 6th rounder at best."
@MylesASimmons would love for them to get Joe Dhal out of Washington State. Help protect our QB.
"Wanted Wentz, but I'll take Goff."
"In bball related news, Wade was totally fouled on that last shot. Sorry NBA."
Please pick Wentz.....
@Yellowcard @VansWarpedTour #yes
Absolutely hate it when I see people take the elevator in buildings when they clearly don't need too. Stop being lazy.
Greatest shot ever in my opinion. https://t.co/NsvRMz0QbV
"While I'll be okay with either Goff or Wentz as the Rams first pick, my hoping is that they go with Wentz."
@Sum41 man I wish you guys were going to be in Washington with @VansWarpedTour!

Until Dawn. The Order 1886. Twilight Princess HD. Star Fox Zero. I think I'm good on games for a while!
The only positive of Steph being hurt for the warriors is that Klay is showing he can lead them to victories in his absence.
@ZeldaUniverse leave him has he is!
"I used to hate it, but now I freaking love beer."
@MsMengarelli especially the Damn sage rats!
@BrunsonTanner LAKER*
"I'll never forget my first NBA game that I remember,was watching Kobe in the playoffs on TV and seeing how great he was."
"And has a Maker and Kobe fan my whole life, it's extremely hard for me to believe that he played his final game last night. Too surreal."
I still can't believe how great the game of basketball was represented last night. Kobe dropping 60! Warriors 73 wins! Steph 402 3's!
#ThankYouKobe
#MambaDay
"""You asked for my hustle. I have you my heart because it had that much more to give."""
Cannot believe tomorrow night is Kobe's last game in the NBA.
@InsideHoops @nuggets just like Jusuf NurkiÄ‡ for the Nuggets the year before.
No lie here. The worst. https://t.co/Ak85YdlCsk
@SacramentoKings  I hope he gets in the court sometime for the last few games!
A+ tweet. ðŸ‘Œ https://t.co/fEGnO1OOgG
@GoodmanESPN Jeff why do a lot of these young guys transfer from their first schools after only one year?
@hoopshype I feel like someone needs to give Ewing a chance to coach.
OH GEE IM SORRY WHAT ATE YOU 5?

@fhnixon what's your favorite beer my dude?
@NetherRealm do I really have to complete the tutorial on Mortal Kombat X JUST to play the story mode?
"Ellensburg, I thank you for getting up to 70 degrees and ðŸŒž just at the start of spring quarter! This will be an awesome quarter."
Well two of my three classes have gone the full time on what is typically syllabus day. Why not make it three for three?
Can it be April 7th already? #Refundday
"Way to be classy, NCAA https://t.co/0pwiqCprRI"
Glad to see Oregon getting rocked by Oklahoma. #MarchMadness
"#westsidepizza in Eburg is awesome! Place has good deals, good pizza. I mean they hooked it up with free breadsticks!"
@NintendoAmerica #TwilightPrincessHD I need the guide so I can finally get 100% completion for a Zelda game!
Damn it!
@dekker for the win! https://t.co/BnxcmHy129
In my personal opinion the best two days in sports are the first two days of #MarchMadness
@CBItourney awesome to see that literally every game was decided by only 8 or fewer points!
"Also, why in the hell did the selection committee put Syracuse in the tournament? And as a 10 seed?! That's just wrong."
Just looked at my bracket. I'm not comfortable with any of my picks except for my pick to win it all in Michigan State.
I just might be able to pull this off...
Selection committee got plenty wrong today. #SelectionSunday
"And honestly, UK deserved a 3 seed."
"It's a shame that mediocrity will alway be better than ""the little guys."""
Really upset w/selection committee. There were 4 teams that deserves to be in the tourney despite not winning their conference tourney.
"@ZeldaUniverse 1. Majoras Mask.
2. Wind Waker
3. Twilight Princess 
(4. Ocorina Of Time)"
Don't believe Oregon should have been a 1 seed. Watch out for Mich. St. #SelectionSunday
I thought we had a deal with the whole snow bullshit Eburg...
@coldrain_jp @silverstein you guys killed it last night! Thanks for an awesome show!
@NintendoAmerica Mario 64! #SweepsEntry #MAR10Day
These extra credit points are going to be huge for me!
With none of the too teams winning their conference tourney so far means there's less chance of an upset in the #NCAA tourney.
Just waiting for the day Steph Curry or Klay Thompson hits 12 or more 3's in a game now.
@NFL @LtShinySides_
"@Gamez_PFS this is the saddest news I've ever read on Twitter. Not so much for cook, but for Long and Laurenitus"
@Gamez_PFS WTF
Love seeing the sun out. Now it just needs to dry everything up so I can go hiking!
#bringbackclonehigh @LtShinySides_
#playposey #fireinyourbelly
Funny how much more full a classroom is the day of an exam.
I wanted that win so badly for these boys.
There is a light at the end of the tunnel. We will turn this around and make everyone believe. Trust the process.
I swear Wilson Creek is out in the middle of no where.
@LtShinySides_ this is why Chris Long is the best. Lol https://t.co/QsObarGZed

"Are you kidding me, St. Louis"
@ZeldaUniverse any word on if/when Majoras Mask will be pit on the Nintendo E-Shop for the Wii U?
"Kellen Moore now with 400+ yards passing and 3 TD's. Sadly, two picks and a fumble as well."
"DAMN IT, KELLEN."
"Damn it, Kellen..."
@De11eDonne #thelegendofzelda #ocorinaoftime #majorasmask
"I would really like it if the snow stopped. As much as I enjoy snow, I really dislike driving in it."
"Since I am not playing for first place in my fantasy league, I'm starting Kellen Moore in my final game this weekend. Because why not."
@fhnixon how do you manage 11 leagues?!
@LtShinySides_ your favorite song is getting a music video!  https://t.co/fWOAPyQv5u
@lusfilip @ZeldaUniverse @ZeldaBrasil dude I so envy you but you need majoras mask 3DS!
"@Gamez_PFS actually Josh, it was the CWAC"
Also very sad to hear about Bo Ryan retiring. A fantastic coach and one who I look up too and want to model my coaching after. #ThanksBo
Tough loss tonight. We have to keep our heads high. We will turn it around it just takes patience and learning.
Mariners are looking like a whole different team this off season. This will fun to watch and see how many more moves they make.
Man it is pouring today!
"Just know I'm not trying to upset you. I just miss you, man. You're my best friend."
"Call it what you want, but I'm really beginning to miss my best friend."

@LtShinySides_ NO! https://t.co/RmT3XWdPTU
Not quite sure how people can't be impressed with what Carr is doing with the Raiders. He has grown since last year. Deff a franchise QB.
I love all of the people I will soon get the honor of calling family. They have accepted me like on of their own. Its pretty great.
This deserves endless retweets.  https://t.co/lOe17dpPcH
"Love, love, LOVE the Rockets struggles early this young NBA season. Came in thinking way to highly of themselves. Especially Harden."

Very sad news in the NBA. Flip Saunders was a great coach and better mentor and person. Will be missed dearly.
@LtShinySides_ no. No. NO. NO!  https://t.co/XIcMcmRzNw
