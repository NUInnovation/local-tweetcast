If you're reading this... I love you.
@LadyKateBond I'd love to sit down with you and hear why you feel that way about Bernie! We're due for a lunch anyway! xoxo
@LadyKateBond Agreed. I really just wish people would support their candidates and not dig at each other. GOP is the major problem!
@LadyKateBond I don't 100% agree bout claps. To me they're timed with the information that a neutral person was who they wanted to speak.
@LadyKateBond I'm bummed out about that idea too. I just don't know if that was the intention. A lot of the Bernie supporters are Latino!
@LadyKateBond One positive is that I now know who she is and can look up what she's done!
@LadyKateBond Get it!!! &lt;3
@LadyKateBond We also don't know if any of those Bernie supporters were able to translate and didn't go up to withhold their own bias.
@LadyKateBond I still think we can't say for sure what they were clapping for.
"@LadyKateBond I get that. I do wonder if everyone knew who she was, though. I think the backlash online was the worst part."
Lettuce tastes bad.
@LadyKateBond Questionable.
"@LadyKateBond Cause the first to me, despite the fact that I didn't know of her before this incident, is not great but the latter is..."
@LadyKateBond Is it the fact that with her record her integrity should have not been questioned or that the booing and then claps happened?
@LadyKateBond Not being there or the people who clapped I really can't speak as to why they did but I understand wanting a neutral speaker.
@LadyKateBond Got ya!
@LadyKateBond Cause I agree there is no need to attack her for her interpretation but do think it's unfortunate she jumped to conclusions.
@LadyKateBond Are you specifically addressing the response to Huerta or the situation that occurred on stage?
@LadyKateBond Can't speak for anyone else but I think HRC supporters were very eager to throw Bernie supporters under the bus w/ out facts.
@LouieAnderson on @BasketsFX is some brilliant fucking work from a very gifted actor that needs to be recognized.
