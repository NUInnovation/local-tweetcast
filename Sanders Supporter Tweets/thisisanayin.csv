Ignore my public therapy session with myself lol
@thisisanayin this probably stems from people only wanting to hookup with me and never actually wanting to get to know me 🙃🙃
@thisisanayin isn't it usually the other way around?
It's kinda funny that I'm confident in my looks but I have low self-esteem when it comes to my personality and lack of accomplishments🙂🙃🙂
Okay listing things you like about yourself is really hard! But I'm glad this list is longer than it would've been 2 years ago. Progress!
"@thisisanayin I nails always look nice and are perfectly polished, I think I'm funny sometimes."
@karablong thanks ☺️
"@thisisanayin I've been sales associate of the month a couple times this year, I'm a good cook, I always pay my bills."
"My eyebrows are pretty decent, I've started working out regularly, my ass is spectacular, I cleaned my room recently, I'm not pregnant."
Okay now I'm gonna list good things about myself so I feel better.
Well that was a depressing rant. But I feel like I'm doing nothing with my life and I'm salty af about seeing everyone becoming successful
@thisisanayin I think about dying all the time. But at least my ass looks great 💁🏻
"@thisisanayin of the few friends I have 80% of them don't live in the same state as me, Im constantly getting used by fuckbois 🙄"
"I'm almost 22, I have no degree, $25,000 in debt, I have a shit job so I have to live w/ my parents, my anxiety still controls me"
I thought I could handle seeing people's college graduation pics on Facebook but I totally can't. I feel like a failure 😐
Since I'm not graduating college this week like most people my age I might as well throw myself down a flight of stairs 🙃
"Everyone I went to high school with is graduating college this weekend. I, on the other hand have watched 26 episodes of 30rock today 🙃🙃"
Sorry guys but I just saw Civil War and I'm v excited about Bucky Barnes getting a bigger role in this movie ☺️☺️
BUCKY BARNES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@briannaUrie where's that top from?
@itsjesstucker lol sorry this is literally me every time I watch property brothers 😂
@itsjesstucker why do they also have zero imagination and refuse to consider a house that has ugly tile floors? Like y'all can fix that!
Same  https://t.co/wz3ipBvvjv
I killed the spider and it was so gross I'm gonna throw up 😖😖
Halfway through my spaghetti eating and a giant spider comes down from the ceiling 😖😖😖😖😖 im not hungry anymore
Why am I making spaghetti at midnight? I'm bad at being a responsible adult
Like my eyes are offended by this IG update! Like it physically hurts to look at it
The Instagram update is so ugly 😖 who let that happen! I don't even wanna see the icon on my phone let alone go in the app now 😑
So when are they gonna stop casting Emma Roberts to play the snobby teen? She's like 25
@ohvanesa tru
This girl I went to college with posted this on Facebook and like honestly.. same https://t.co/iubqXgBHmp
I just realized that a year ago today was the last show I've been too. Why don't bands come to Minnesota anymore?
@thisisanayin lmao 😂 who let me tweet at 4 am!!
"2009 was a simpler time. Obama just started his presidency, people wore neon colors for no reason and grandparents weren't on Facebook yet."
Why do I still let my ex sext me all the time? Why do I sext back? 🙄

I had a dream last night that I had broken glass in my mouth. Wtf is that supposed to mean? I'm still thinking about this hours later
@itsjesstucker if I disappear in the next week you'll know why 😂
@itsjesstucker lmao is it really slutshaming if its kinda pedophilia?
@itsjesstucker if you're 19 dating a boy that's got a whole year of high school left its kinda gross 💁🏻
@itsjesstucker she's 19
@itsjesstucker she's the one dating a boy that barely just turned 17

Stop having crushes on people that aren't me 🙄💁🏻
@bandsrfabtho I loved the smell of this bathbomb too!
@thisisanayin wtf is wrong with me lol
"My midnight snack included tons of butter, 4 slices or cinnamon toast, half a bag of veggies sticks and a lot of hummus."

I wish you could force suppress memories. Cause I want to completely forget this
I wish I would have trusted my instincts and not have made that kind of mistake again 😑
🙄🙄🙄
Probably never gonna see that guy again. Bye bitch
Found out Letlive. is coming to town this summer and playing a small venue. I can't wait to get crushed to death in the pit ☺️

I thought the milk fic got buried years ago. Who brought this back!
Who is letting Gerard read the milk fic!!! No 😳
@thisisanayin btw I'm only on season 1 of 30 Rock
@HeyMoonImADiva 😘😘
@thisisanayin you're not supposed to agree that I'm trash!!!!! I'm gonna fight you
Should I stop procrastinating applying for another job?
"If you live in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania or Rhode Island please vote today #SuperTuesday #FeelTheBern"
Who cares. I'm going back to sleep
I didn't know I could get texts from France. Am i gonna get charged extra if I text back? 🤔
