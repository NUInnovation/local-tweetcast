"So to be clear. Women? Not yours to make decisions ON. Women make decisions too. Crazy, I know."

@KjartanKennedy Utter purrfection. There's a heaven after all!
I wrote 3 essays today #SeniorYearIn5Words #success
"@Frups1 Oh no, this isn't about people who didn't register. This is about people who's registration or affiliation was purged."
"FYI: I have no incentive to listen to what you're saying if your first strategy is to #mansplain, insult me, and/or degrade my intelligence"
Today. #Seattle #sun @seattlecenter https://t.co/yu4NH0t81B
When strangers decide the best strategy for engaging in political 'education' is insulting your intelligence https://t.co/aX0rPvvmuG
"I have endured my first Twitter attack for making an inflammatory comment. Here's to endurance, acknowledging differences, and letting go."
I'd like to send a shoutout to @Realistsofly for being the ONLY person tonight to engage in compassionate political discourse. Thank you.
Voting itself should be as easy as checking Facebook. This is the 21st century.
"In the last five minutes I've been called 'dumb,' 'stupid,' and told to refund my education. Because that's political discourse apparently?"
As a Bernie supporter I refuse to succumb to condescension tactics and malicious commentary. I'd hope the same of everyone.
Apparently making comments on Twitter regarding potential voter fraud and political corruption result in malicious &amp; paternalistic backlash
@scottrgordon paternalistic and malicious comments are not the way to enlighten people. My claim is a statement on voter affil. issues.
@Realistsofly I refuse to bel. that the US is so un-advanced that voters should need to check weekly to ensure their affil. isn't changed.
I refuse to believe that the US is so un-advanced that voters have to check weekly to ensure their affiliation isn't changed. That's absurd.
"Love how provocative twts regarding the Hill campaign result in sarcastic, dismissive, and malicious comments rather than adult discussion."
@rosieriveter4 money raised by the American people is unequivocally different in implication than money raised by corporate donors
@ShimminyKricket but money donated by individual Americans is unequivocally different in implication than money raised by corporate donors
"@Realistsofly ...which is unfortunate, but that doesn't mean they don't still have a right to vote."
"@Realistsofly Regardless, you make excellent points and I send respect and kindness your way :)"
@Realistsofly this is primarily and issue of party affiliations being changed to unaffiliated unbeknownst to voters. Emergency lawsuit filed
"@Realistsofly of course it is! Absolutely. But when over 3.2 million people can't submit ballots &amp; voter purging occurs, that's an issue."

"I resent the accusation that I'm unrealistic in my support for Sanders. If political honesty is unrealistic, this isn't the country for me."
I am NOT #bernieorbust. I will vote for Hillary should it come down to it. But this isn't the end of the fight. #StillSanders
I would love a woman president. But I won't vote for Hillary for the sake of estrogen in the white house. She is not the better candidate.
"I don't refuse to vote for Hillary because she's a woman. As a feminist, I refuse to vote for her JUST because she's a woman. #feelthebern"
"Underhanded corruption, greed, and decade-by-decade, day-by-day inconsistency are not what I want in my president #HillNo #StillSanders"
I believe that career-long honesty and compassion should be requisite qualities of politicians. That's why I'm #StillSanders
"Funny how Bernie can win 49 out of 62 counties in NY and still 'loose.' But then again, money buys politics. #voterfraud #votersuppression"
"If voter suppression hadn't been an issue yesterday, it's likely Bernie would have won the #NYPrimary by a significant margin. #Corruption"
Over 3.2 million independent voters suppressed of their voting rights yesterday. That is not democracy. #StillSanders
Bernie is currently in a better place to win the candidacy than Obama was in 2008 #StillSanders
"I'm #StillSanders because I don't believe in forfeiting my values for political normalcy. This is about all people, not just the elite few."
"Despite claims being made by the media, #Bernie CAN still win the race. He won almost every county in NY despite his ""loss."" Keep voting."
The fight is NOT over until the American people give in to corrupt politics. We haven't. #StillSanders #feelthebern #bernbabybern
@BernieSanders we're still in it with you. For the long haul. Way to narrow the margin tonight! Let's win this thing. #bernbabybern

@Truthdoxxer Not that I know of. There are some unofficial results floating around but I don't know of anything official.
"Pissed with the #DNC, proud of #WAcaucus voters for sticking it out. It's time for a political revolution &amp; to fight for true #democracy."
"We need a to change the #WAcaucus to a primary. Today was ridiculous: disorganized, rigged for confusion, and undemocratic."
I wasn't a delegate or alt. today but I'm so grateful to those who volunteered and put in the time. Let's change the system. #FeelTheBern
