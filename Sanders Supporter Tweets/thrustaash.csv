@StatzerNicholas @MSPRlNKLE It's okay for the cops to be quiet. It's public acknowledgement of the situation.
"@MSPRlNKLE @thrustaash A person's worth isn't determined by their fame. He was only a musician, not a civil rights leader."

@MSPRlNKLE @thrustaash The acknowledgement that they know this happened.
