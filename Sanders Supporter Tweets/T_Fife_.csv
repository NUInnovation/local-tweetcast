"Disparaging someone for their dialect is crude. There is no ""right"" pronunciation, no one lexicon, and certainly no ""proper"" way to speak."
"So yes, ""aks"" is a pronunciation of ""ask,"" ""warsh"" is fine, ""nukular"" is a-ok, and ""hyuge"" and ""yuge"" are both great."
"People speak differently based on where they live (geolect), their social class (sociolect), and their ethnicity (ethnolect)."
There are 149 standard dialects of English across the world. 33 of them are dialects of American English.

Anderson not letting anybody talk over him. He gets to the core of the issues. That's impressive journalism.
Everybody is trying to counter Bernie Sanders. That's why it's a #DebateWithBernie.
"If it wasn't that complicated, Clinton, then why don't you have a comprehensive plan for gun control? Bernie does."
Bernie the only one who didn't need to introduce himself at all; he went straight for policy because that's what matters.
