@melimel521 @TammyKosiancic @ThankYouBernie @TweetingYarnie I will support the best campaign for taking down the establishment.
@TammyKosiancic @ThankYouBernie @TweetingYarnie How does it hurt Bernie? It shows we'll support him whatever he chooses.
"@1BernieCA Doing some research, I'm pretty sure it was Hillary. This is too meta."
"So Hillary or Bernie, who said ""Love Trumps Hate"" first?"
Everyone should be able to vote in a number of primaries of their choosing. Not just one.

I honestly don't care if Bernie Sanders wins any more. That's not what activism is about. Activism is about making a difference.
