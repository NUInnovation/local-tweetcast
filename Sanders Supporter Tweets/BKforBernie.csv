When we talk about 'lessons from Iraq' surely intervention as defacto policy must be examined. @lizadonnelly @chemical_lab
@lizadonnelly @chemical_lab I'm sure. But this is an area of expertise for her! She led policy of intervention as SoS and advocates it today
@lizadonnelly @chemical_lab But we continue to see policies that fly in the face of diplo. ike a No-Fly over Syria. Shoot at Russian planes?
@lizadonnelly @chemical_lab One might imagine with all her skills she could have resolved matters thru diplomacy as SoS
