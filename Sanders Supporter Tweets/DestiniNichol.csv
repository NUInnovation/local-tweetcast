@BernieSanders won Indiana but @CNN is reporting as if Clinton did #clintonnewsnetwork
@TierneyFine @TheYoungTurks @BernieSanders tbh that's what I'm thinking too just trying to get more opinions
@TheYoungTurks @BernieSanders or being willing to accept a write in?
@TheYoungTurks do you think @BernieSanders would be willing to run third party? I don't think I'd be for it if he isn't willing #TYTLive
I feel unsure backing #BernieOrBust without @BernieSanders expressing willingness to accept third party run or write in
@TheYoungTurks do you think he would accept a third party ticket?
@TheYoungTurks what do you guys think about the #BernieOrBust movement?
#BernieOrBust because I'm not sure unless he would be willing to run third party
"#BernieorBust people, do you think Bernie would accept running third party? Serious question."
@sarahthethinker I'll be up for graduation  so I'll bring her one; they are a little beat up from marches though

Straight up begging Hilary to release speech transcripts and she doesn't answer the actual question again #DemTownHall
