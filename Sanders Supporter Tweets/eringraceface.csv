@SkiNorthstar @Vailmtn Get your act together. This is horrific.  https://t.co/Zj5oltvRho #NoMountainForYoungWomen #ViolenceAtVail
@SkiNorthstar snow is not nearly as surprising as your lack of concern over violence against women at your resort https://t.co/Zj5oltvRho
Absolutely horrific: https://t.co/Zj5oltvRho  I can't believe @vailmtn just shrugged off this assault of a woman at their resort.
Young intersectional feminists know that you can't use the system to beat the system. That's why these feminists are voting @BernieSanders
