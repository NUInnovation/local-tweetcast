I look so homeless I don't even care rn.
Finally UW cancels classes.
@chevy_mads @vestablaire I was about to say the same
This is Tyler of Toys R Us. He is an awesome dad and kinda cute. https://t.co/64onvLcUI7
I miss you and it's been twenty minutes 😂😂😂
I'm early to my 9am lab for once! And only three other people are here
*struts on campus listing to Pussycat dolls
@sugarberrydrip I'm too short to be a model 😭😭😭
I haven't ate all day. I feel like a vogue model.
@haleynicoleem and you can tweet bout it and not text. Rude
@haleynicoleem bitch you live together. Every night is an us night
@haleynicoleem ewe. I'm all about long distance relationships. Like I need to be two hours away from yo' ass
Why do I like you so much?

So much anxiety. Why does caffeine have to make anxiety worse? Like I need my double shot expresso everyday.
I love my Chanel cologne
Properly starting the day off. https://t.co/ASGTN0UBhk
I made a tumbler. I might have a new addiction.
@thiskidstorm bitch betta have my money
Properly going to have a panic attack. It's fine
That contour line is too thick honey
Perhaps I want to be a clinical psychologist so I can finally understand people 😂😂😂
I just don't get people.
Stood at the elevator waiting for five minutes then I realized I didn't press the button. 😂
@Teazyy I'll get my Ouija board rn.
@Teazyy I'm dying.  https://t.co/x91ora8Gow
"@Teazyy how does one acquire this ""premium subscription""?"
@Teazyy Are you going to camboy it?

For the first time in history it's going to start raining meeeeeeeeeeeen. -The Weather Girls
@haleynicoleem lol no

May or may not have gotten too real with people last night and ruined a friendship or two. I'm almost not even sorry.
Little foots mom just died and I'm in tears 😂😭
@Teazyy @chevy_mads @vestablaire  https://t.co/DafQlJnn0M

Struts on campus in Birkenstocks and socks

So @chevy_mads will retweet but can't reply to me. Literally so rude. 😂😂😂
"I wonder why @Teazyy is Big Daddy? Oh wait, I think I know 🤓"
"Big feet, small hands, big surprise 😏"
@chandlerdean18 see you in two hours 😂
I call the boy I like daddy all the time. I find it ironic.
Made an appointment with my professor and I'm kinda done waiting. It's been almost thirty min.
Talks about psych to someone and then sees my PSY1000 professor from last semester.
@Teazyy I'm dying. Save me with your EMT skills. I don't like breathless compressions 😏😏😏
@Teazyy  https://t.co/76RrbT7yl4

When I drive long distances I jam the fuck out to Lana Del Rey.
@Teazyy is kinda cute https://t.co/mVvXd0aHqr
You know it's real when you delete your Tinder.
@chevy_mads I was so white girl wasted. It was a blast.
@chevy_mads looking cute af in her new train pic 😍😍😍😍
I wonder what you're doing right now.
@sugarberrydrip there is no such thing as too much ⭐️💵
This feels so right. It's kinda scary letting yourself have feelings.
Cute boy coming to see me? This never happens 🤓
@chevy_mads I just want to not eat alone in Wash. #sorrynotsorry
@Teazyy  https://t.co/YKI798eCFb
@haleynicoleem and you have no right to judge. At least the whole side isn't wreck and doesn't have a spider web windshield.
@haleynicoleem lol I like it
@haleynicoleem I'm currently looking at an Audi A6 Avant Wagon ☺️
People don't get my humor. Apparently people don't find it funny when you throw shade.
"@FCattles What is the ""real world""? Am I currently in a different world? If so someone please send help 😂. I totally get what you're saying."
Scratch that. I had a bite of salad. Now I'm full.
"I had a trenta iced coffee this morning, took an addy, won't eat until about nine tonight 😂😂😂."

I violently woke up and remembered I have homework due by 12...
@sugarberrydrip We need to kick it.
"@sugarberrydrip at first I thought it said ""sweet and bass"" then I was like oh I like that song Sweet and Sour by Matt or mike Williams."
@chevy_mads @SparrowVideo Yasss!
@haleynicoleem I like someone and I hate it lol.
Ewe; feelings suck. Why can't I just be a heartless bitch like I was. I mean I still am but ewe feelings. Why do I like you?
Ever open a snap story and regret opening it? Literally so annoyed rn.
Yes Mama.  https://t.co/WacMN5IpI7
