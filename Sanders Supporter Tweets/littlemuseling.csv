@jimmy_dore @TYTNetwork Thank you for speaking so passionately abt the issues facing most Americans: income inequality. They need to listen!
@jimmy_dore Damn good job on this debate!! You knocked it out of the park!!! https://t.co/SLCz76XIL0
@cenkuygur @AnaKasparian Same argument against poor ppl. Some get away w/abuse so all should suffer. Baby w/the bath water argument no good.
"@TheDailyShow if he had taken the factors of the discontent with the establishment that he is a part of into account, could've been accurate"
@cenkuygur #tytlive Trumps ability to be dynamic-good or bad-and bounce back from failure will be his successful campaign. Terrifying.
@cenkuygur THANK YOU for the distinction between criticism and smear. Please highlight in a clip for reference!!! NEED THIS! #tytlive
@AnaKasparian fabu!
"@billmaher sometimes they don't even need words. I present your weird, grumpy neighbor: https://t.co/nd1HymzxSM"
@JordanChariton @politico but it'll never happen...isn't that what they keep telling us? /s
@JordanChariton #FeelThePolls love it!
ALL OF THIS https://t.co/n8TQRLQWNA
Itching for #tytlive! I want my news!!! #addict
This needs to be viral. https://t.co/SfTdWdZ1Cn
The populist and the establishment are coalescing on the right. We need #CrazyBernie to get us through this. https://t.co/6SIInEPH36
@realDonaldTrump youre adorable. You went against a bunch of losers and @HillaryClinton is a loser to. You wont know how to handle a winner.

"@cenkuygur @SenSanders weird, white West Virginia, right? It even has a V in it like Vermont! No wonder Bernie won! Not even really west!"
This makes me happy on 15 levels. https://t.co/mNC3Trg2Kr
"@jiadarola apparently West Virginia is weird now, too. Instead of viral, are things going Vermont now? ðŸ˜œ https://t.co/ZF2fYejQFZ"
@JacksonWkelly thanks!
@cenkuygur helped canvas on Wendy Davis campaign. HIGHLY disorganized too. I blame that more than anything. #tytlive

"@zaskoda @Moni100 lol, more like she is a misleader who doesn't understand independents vote in the general election. Or doesn't care."
"@Moni100 Then why doesn't Clinton, the weaker and more disliked candidate, drop out? I know u hate logic but damn."
"@Moni100 @zaskoda @maddow @BernieSanders lol, because if Hillary can't win by starting now vs July, it will be Sanders fault? Sure."
@RBReich thanks for being an awesome economist. ::fist bump::
"@PaulBegala @ABswl16 @Dano50 I'd like to think if Clinton was as strong as she says she is, going to convention would actually improve img."
@PaulBegala @ABswl16 @Dano50 Berner here. I would support her to go to convention if Bernie was leading. Why have this setup if never to use
@ABswl16 I will be rubbing this in your face. https://t.co/dHOPB0UO0f
@ABswl16 have fun crying like a little bitch when Bernie takes Cali! ðŸ˜˜
@ABswl16 I didn't nor did I ever claim to be an economist. Want a cookie?
"@ABswl16 good debaters don't need logical fallacies to ""win."""
@ABswl16 @RBReich is not some hack job economist. You're becoming a bore. https://t.co/WJO8ddm4rx
@ABswl16 are you sure you're really a lawyer? You're horrible at arguing. ðŸ˜‚
"@ABswl16 you made assessment no economist approves, I proved wrong. Never said some economist disapprove, that is obvious."
@ABswl16 *yawn* https://t.co/52uTYQN3xv
"@ABswl16 you forgot the ""70"" behind that one. https://t.co/hXnD6khvT2"
@ABswl16 I'll take that as a yes.
@ABswl16 and Robert Reich thinks Sanders economic plan is A+++ He was good enough for the Clinton's.... ðŸ˜’
@ABswl16 I volunteer at shelters. Carry non perishable food&amp;water to give to the homeless in CoS when I go around town. Did I pass?
"@ABswl16 but no denying it, just like the rest of the paid for trolls. Being those things doesn't exempt you from being a sellout."
@ABswl16 most economist agree we need this. Sorry you're too narrow minded for it.
@ABswl16 how's it feel to sell your soul a comment at a time? Must be pretty hard up to support criminal stealing America's democracy.
"@ABswl16 no, I'm willing to help Bernie get elected. Have I helped you collect enough tonight? #MillionDollarTrolls"
"@ABswl16  want go to conspiracies? Hillary laughing about getting a child molester off, that's gotta make you feel great."
@ABswl16 @DrJillStein glad you have the privilege of affording neoliberal policies. I don't. My son deserves college.
@ABswl16 on what? He's being dismissed whole campaign by dems....more worried about back and forth cry-bully w/no substance w/Trump vs HRC
@ABswl16 @CNN idk? Just being honest!
@ABswl16 @DrJillStein Will get my vote in Colorado if Bernie is not on the ticket. Hillary lost my vote w/fracking and universal HC abandon.
"@ABswl16 willing to take as part of average, but considering she's slated to lose next several contests, poor favor rating, again, why risk?"
@ABswl16 forgive me for being a weency bit skeptical of @CNN-they are Hillary donors
@ABswl16 @Moni100 @zaskoda @maddow @BernieSanders I don't like caucuses either. Better now?
@ABswl16 @Moni100 @zaskoda @maddow averages don't reflect https://t.co/D64B75v0cv
"@ABswl16 @Moni100 @zaskoda @maddow @BernieSanders because closed primaries that make zero sense in open general elections, maybe?"
@ABswl16 @Moni100 @zaskoda @maddow last I saw it was single/some HRC losing to Trump. Bernie does better. Why risk it? Oh yeah $$$$ ðŸ™„
"@Moni100 @zaskoda @ABswl16 @maddow @BernieSanders logic, what's your excuse?"
"@Moni100 @zaskoda @ABswl16 @maddow @BernieSanders if Hillary's chances are based on Bernie leaving early, maybe we need someone better."
"@Moni100 @ABswl16 @zaskoda @maddow @BernieSanders if you gave a shit abt the country, you'd want who beats Trump twice as well as Hillary"
"@maddow @BernieSanders @POTUS YAAAAAAAAS. I'm sure your staff would appreciate the break, Rachel."
"@Moni100 @zaskoda @maddow @BernieSanders point out something not right and I'm an idiot? Go ahead and block, you're not worth the time."
@Moni100 @zaskoda @maddow @BernieSanders because neoliberalism is better than democratic socialism? Are you mad? ðŸ˜¢ healthcare &gt; war

@maddow @BernieSanders $20 now to #FeelTheBern
@maddow @BernieSanders $17 to #FeelTheBern
@maddow @BernieSanders I'll donate $1 dollar per every negative Bernie comment to his campaign. Haters want to help out? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

@jaysandheat13 @Amy_Siskind @politico pro tip-just stop insulting the intelligence of Bernie supporters. We didn't come and won't go lightly
@jaysandheat13 @Amy_Siskind @politico I'm not and you're a simpleton for suggesting I am. It is not my fault she did not earn my vote.
@FoxNews oh my lord. All of you would be losing your mind if he didn't drink it #neverhappy.
@nytimes how about we leave that up to @britneyspears and her conservator and stay the fuck out of their biz?
@zachhaller @JeffMyers82 and it's not like we haven't heard these things already? Reforming into a sound bite is the winning strategy? Smh
