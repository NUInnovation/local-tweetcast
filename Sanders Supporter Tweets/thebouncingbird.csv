"Okay if Thoros of Myr wasn't in that scene but he's supposed to be in season six, I think it's happening."
@mumphrey @devincf plus I'm worried about these kids whose baby pictures and videos are turned into memes. That's weird to grow up with.
@mumphrey @devincf I was a complete jackass about anime. I never doxxed anyone or told them to kill themselves. Today is nuts.
"@devincf @mumphrey in all fairness, I started hella young. Would prefer we be allowed to observe until 18. Then engage."
"@devincf @mumphrey if/when I have kids, they're not going near internet until 13 and then it's Wikipedia only."
@williambgoss Veep?
@JDWRudy25 I spent Saturday night at home watching WWII movies. I should get out more.
@JDWRudy25 I have HBO Next but it's more fun to watch at the bar with people

@jessiesarah doubtful. Too many common people. (Also I haven't seen any pictures of her there)

@AngrygirLcomics Problem is there is the risk of isolating and pissing off people that need persuading.
@AngrygirLcomics I was fucking mortified they needed to make a whole post explaining it to calm down the pissed off teenagers
@AngrygirLcomics Same people who would flip a complete shit about skin color while not understanding optics and color theory
@pattonoswalt All my love to you and your family. Thank you for sharing her with us.
"...Vichy France, and the Saffron Revolution. While listening to Disney music. All of it relevant to what I'm working on."
"Open Wikipedia tabs: Elisabeth, Pied Piper of Hamelin, Ruritania, Normandy landings, Purge, Night of the Long Knives, Epuration legale..."
"Since current animation trends are starting to emulate 80s anime styles, can we go all the way with the music too?"
"Funny part is my favorite cast is all over the place. Pia Douwes as Elisabeth, Sumire Haruno as Death, and Serkan Kaya as Luigi."
"If you love super 90s Alan Menken style music with all the girl power of the era, omg listen to Elisabeth."
Am I listening to too much Elisabeth while I work? #maybe #ichgehornurmir
The Intern is a lot of non-confrontational fluff but the scene in the hotel room hit in the feels for a lot of reasons.
@LeSeanThomas and he's always going to be wheelchair Jimmy to me!
@LeSeanThomas I'm still trying to figure out how his stuff works. Kendrick and Kanye come through but Jimmy is always a bit off.
@jessiesarah aaaahhh!! I love you! :D
Omfg @zacgormania I'm sure you've seen this but I saw this on Reddit and died laughing. Hello from Valhalla https://t.co/EzTrgu7cEm
@scottEweinberg Son of Saul was just released today too
Watching The Intern is giving me flashbacks to working in those awful bullpen offices. Do not miss it.
And of course I rented The Intern because I needed fluff.
@garthinkingcap @SizzlePie @Seahawks Seattle finally has normal pizza??
Son of Saul is available to rent or buy on Amazon Prime. It's one of the hardest movies you'll ever watch but it needs to be watched.
Finally printed hard copies of my feature. Brads and everything. Feels amazing to hold something you made. :) #creativebaby
Yes. I would like this.  https://t.co/Z4KCwifm69
Current state of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party is a fucking Swartzwelder episode of The Simpsons.
Always hated getting calls from @TheDemocrats volunteers screaming down the phone at me to get $150+ donations because Republicans.
"I've only ever had the sweetest phone calls from @BernieSanders' volunteers asking if I have time to help out. Take notes, @TheDemocrats."
@Sailor_Moon_CA next arc is my favorite in the comic and I'm stressing they'll make a balls of it.
@Sailor_Moon_CA new series has improved a lot since the first two seasons but still need to dial it back
"I know I won't shut up, but the original Sailor Moon series had SUCH strong art direction. It's amazing how they used color and staging."
Watching Sailor Moon Crystal is like seeing someone who's fussed over their eyelashes without putting on foundation. #lolthatwasneverme
"I was listening to a 'Paris Cafe' jazz station when ""I Will Wait For You"" came on and I had to shut it off immediately."
RT if you still can't see any reference to Jurassic Bark without bursting into tears.
@MBartyzel Main reason I yell back at them. I want these creeps to learn bad things could happen to them if they violate a girl's space.
"@MBartyzel I've had people call me intimidating and crazy my whole life, and I think that's what's scared off perverts from going further."
@MBartyzel I maintain it always has to do with girls being nice. Their boundaries get pushed further and they're seen as weak.
Anime inside baseball is just the sweetest part of life. https://t.co/4a6Ibej0PE
"@MBartyzel And I dressed the complete opposite of how I do now, so it had nothing to do with being too ""sexy""."
This is why I'm mean about it. This is why I try to make them cry and question their life choices. Being nice gets us murdered.

@LeSeanThomas omg I haven't done this in years. Time to update!
@Fyre_flye omg. What's next? Plague Dogs?
@scottEweinberg yes!! I want to hear what you think.
Anyone ever applied rhinestones to a wall pattern? I've got an idea but not sure if it'll be ridiculous.
RT if you also looked for the paper towels only to realize you left them at the grocery store four days ago #FML
@MarieMJS @TheAdvocateMag we're working on it. :/
Only more recently I'm reading about people with light blue eyes being more light sensitive. Realized I've worn sunglasses for years.
"It sounds silly but if I don't leave the house with sunglasses, it's painful and difficult to see if the sun is out."
Talking to a friend the other day about his need for glasses and that was honestly the first time it hit me that I need glasses too.

@Terri_Schwartz @Isaac_H_Wright omfg a Pokemon reference. Love it. :)
@somebadideas @mtgilchrist @TheWolfman they barely enforce the no talking/no kids policies in NY anyway
@mtgilchrist @TheWolfman @devincf Drafthouse in NY is like this too. People always bring talking kids.

"@LeSeanThomas I'm so thirsty for a Bakuretsu Hunter remake. If they let the parody side of it off the leash, could you imagine?"
@leeunkrich I'm an honest to god fangirl of opera. Seen over 50 shows and eager for more.
"Actually, tweeps, recommend me some shit. Does Netflix have any good 80s anime or do I have to sign up for Hulu?"
"I love the original Dirty Pair OAV song ""By Yourself"". It's the perfect 80s anime song."
"On a lighter note, revisiting my favorite anime music from the 80s and 90s is so relaxing it's ridiculous. Portland, you need a Book Off."
It's expensive and unbalanced everywhere else too. Oligarchies rule in most other major countries right now.
"Also do not leave the country. If your life is actually in danger, I understand, but if you can, stay. It won't get better if the good leave"
"People, if we have to pick between Cersei and Ramsey, we know the right answer, RIGHT?"
We can't afford to fuck around with this given the level of crazy about to get the Republican nomination because we could lose our rights.
"Friends, this is your reminder that I can't stand Hillary too but if you sit out the election in protest, I will END you."
Just realized why SMC animation is bothering me. Squash and stretch are being used as key frames.
Moon Animate 3 is probably just gonna be a big ass Sailor Moon fight scene with big influences from Korra because this shit needs to happen.
