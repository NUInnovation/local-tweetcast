@Libertea2012 what?
@MLBStatoftheDay @MLB @marwinGF9 I love tweets like this
@Libertea2012 Feel the Bern - we have to vote!! Bernie for our children and grandchildren!!
@CBSNews and that's why all police officers should wear cameras
@sprintcare I'm told you care raise the price at anytime yet I couldn't change my contract. Well its up saturday. I'll pay 5$ a mth on t325$
@sprintcare my bill should be 95$ w tax. Never under 130. Now over 250. Say they can do that. I can't get a boss to talk to me. They suck
@sprintcare I have tried to talk to a sprint supervisor for months. I signed a 70$ unlimited 2 yr contract but not 1 time has my bill
"Spint Care- Thank you to the women that i talked w today. For once i felt listened to and helped,.     : )"
"https://t.co/Of9vpbk2Zc , Sprint Care. I have bookmarked. The Web page cannot be found because you have no Internet or network."
@MrAdeyemiMason @TuckFrump2016_ @blackopsTX wow. You must like trump you sound like him. Exactly. Hateful
"@MrAdeyemiMason @TuckFrump2016_  Your not for Trump for Pres, Are you? He's the most hateful sociopath ran for Pres I ever had to listen to."
"@MrAdeyemiMason @TuckFrump2016_ @blackopsTX wow! What does that mean? She's FOR Trump? Your not, right?"
@People4Bernie @BernieSanders OK I'm almost 52 but I have kids and grandkids who won't have a future if Bernie doesn't win. He's not bought
@People4Bernie @BernieSanders you said that perfectly. He will get the most votes but will he win in this court system? We need Bernie t win
Sprint Care keeps cutting off my phone. I pay 130$ a monyh. My contract was for 70$ but they keep making stuff up. I am house bound&amp;disabled
"No more direct messaging. Sprint Care doesn't want you to know how they are cheating a disabled, agoraphobic,anxiety disorder woman."
Sprint care- I am so disappointed.  Bianca was gonna help me from being overcharged. Now she's unsvailble. I hope that didn't cost her JOB!!
"You lose all this if you have sprint, + network, dropped calls and Noone will help you. Esp since Bianca speaks engl https://t.co/8MgkSnGz4O"
"You know, I wrote to Sprint Care and I finally was getting help w/all the overbilling, now they say she's unavailable! ! No hope. G'by Sprin"
@WomensHealthMag @lenadunham really? Who's doing that? I wanna make sure I don't accept anything from them or end up accidentally following
@GuerrillaDems I'm w Bernie. Recount in Iowa. His numbers were too high. Florida all over again
"@NBCNews Dammit,  I just knew that Bernie had Iowa. Igh. Who wants hillary for president AGAIN? I SURE AS HELL DONT"
@sprintcare @chai_teeaa @Support I had hoped you'd help but I read your tweets. Noone wants or likes sptint. I'm bummed you won't help me
@sprintcare @chai_teeaa @Support you have nothing positive. I had hoped you were gonna help me but your page shows me everyone hatessprint
@sprintcare @chai_teeaa @Support take a look at your tweet page its-oh no we def....please do us!dory for...how can we help...etc. not good!
@sprintcare @JWBalkcom I am
@sprintcare @Nerd0ut @Support and Americans need jobs too
@sprintcare @Nerd0ut @Support and you give everyone the same message. I am not racist at all but I cannot understand the people on the phone
@sprintcare I only get Web on my WiFi and I pay for unlimited everything.  They won't explain why I'm not charged like my contract said
@sprintcare @Khankid_ we need jobs too. I am agoraphobic and sprint won't help me when I pay for unlike Ted talk text and webbut only get We
@sprintcare @Bree_Callahan I have never been helped by an u name Rican worker that talks too fast and I can't understand.  I am not racist
@sprintcare I direct messaged you
@sprintcare I don't even know how to find it. I'll try
@SteveJurevicius @KraftyWurker what? Why? Idk???
@adlangston75 @cfcpac @BernieSanders at least he is trying
"@adlangston75 @cfcpac @BernieSanders why take away all and the only hope we have for some kind if change. Someone that knows -us,THE PEOPLE-"
@samhighfill @EW I love love love Grey's Anatomy and Dennys Duquette!!
@Discommoded @cfcpac @BostonGlobe @HillaryClinton @BernieSanders Bernie lies?? Can u explain that? Please
"@MMFlint @Brains4Bern please God , do not let that happen. We need change. BERNIE SANDERS!!! FOR CHANGE- NO MORE CLINTON OR BUSH'"
"@Libertea2012 @JeanetteJing @BernieSanders pretty awesome thing you said. I pray he wins for my grandbabies sake, heck, for my kids sake!!!"
@Libertea2012 Hilary Clinton sucks as bad now as the first time she tried to be President! !!
@GuerrillaDems BERNIE SANDERS IS THE ONLY PRESIDENT FOR US!!BERNIE FOR REAL CHANGE!!!
@GuerrillaDems heck yeah. That's what I want to hear. Thank uou for the share. :)
@sprintcare my 2 yrs are up April 2nd. They promised 70$a month. Never been under 130 and I was gonna buy a new phone and stay w sprint but
@sprintcare yes I am. 2697885007
@MrBolderin @BernieSanders and? What you want Hillary(again)lol. We know who ran things and who really was president. Or youlike Trump'sspew
Your that troll? Does that mean u are not a Bernie fan
"@Melissaeearle thank you, just getting the knowledge. I never thought I'd like twitter, but it's way better than fb gossip. Aye? :)"
@DavidBouchard18 hey dave. Vote for Bernie Sanders
@SteveJurevicius @iJakeReyna @KraftyWurker are you talking about trump? You must not be talking about our Bernie. Right?
@PaulWDrake @MSNBC @BernieSanders can you explain that to me? What you mean by that Paul?
@Melissaeearle thank you. Just getting the knowledge. :)
@sprintcare they don't keep their commitments. Promise to slash prices to noncustome but what about the customers already signed up for brok
@sprintcare @Support 2697885007 020759
"Thanks for retweeting. We can help get the word out about Bernie,,,, about change. :)"
Yes I like your tweets- For Bernie!! Yes!! :)
@BillieJ34419225 it says you are a contact but you must not be under the same name. :)
@ManOfRust @Brains4Bern @TheBriefing2016 @BernieSanders so are you against Bernie? If so I don't want to follow you or anyone like you
@Brains4Bern why is it- women for Bernie- Men jelous 9f Bernie?
@cfcpac I really believe that we need Bernie for the change that will help our kids and grandkids have a future
@BernieSanders what exactly is a Bernie Moonbat??
@PaulWDrake @MSNBC @BernieSanders what exactly does that mean?
I made a huge mistake. Yes I love Bruckheimer but it's Dick Wolf that does Law &amp;Order. Bruckheimer does all the CSI's!! Which I  also love.
@JBFilms I love Bruckheimer! !! Yay Law and Order - sll of them. :)
@jesuschuygar https://t.co/6J6QAUAKSj
@BernieSanders thank you Bernie Sanders. You are our savior
@Sanders4Potus @BernieSanders say it Bernie Sanders
@gregorykorte @USATODAY nothing about us government or democracy is as strong as it used to be. Thanks to the weak man running it
@JBFilms I love Bruckheimer! !! Yay Law and Order - sll of them. :)
@CBSNews awesome -Thank you to David Bowie wife through her grief for paying tribute to 5 decades of David's career. What an icon.
@parenting Micheal Bochart- look at this honey

@AmerMedicalAssn too much beeping noise 4 dyre
I'm not receiving emails from Twitter | Twitter Help Center https://t.co/HiqJmTglpf via @support
@Sanders4Potus omg that's the worst. Big buisness wins again. I remember when it was about helping people
@teb065 @Brains4Bern @AddInfoOrg dumb people tweet dumb shit. Bernie has over a milli donations from regular people instead of big buisness
@ElBuehn @412V70 @CraigRBrittain @Popehat shut up
@412V70 @CraigRBrittain @ElBuehn @Popehat your an ass!

@DavidBouchard18 so did you buy a car? Is work over?
@MrBolderin @BernieSanders and you MrBolderin need to go somewhere else. We love Bernie Sanders and don't wanna hear your bs.
@PaulWDrake @MSNBC @BernieSanders obviously I wasn't saying that about Bernie. I was tslking yo you PaulWDrake!!. This is FOR BERNIE LOVES.
"@MsNonoESQ @MSNBC @BernieSanders finally, someone that gets it. Look at all the bs from men. Campaign Bernie to Russia. Wow!!"
"@MsNonoESQ @MSNBC @BernieSanders Right on sister, look at the loser men's ""I don't care"" tweets. Ugh!!!"
