#HRC supporters: this is what we hear when you tell us to give up on Bernie and join you. #BernieOrBust https://t.co/yG2zYurXqi
@CNN snap story: FUCK OFFFFFF. Quit acting like Bernie's not still in it. He could still take the election. https://t.co/EVZzW9R7Bc
"@realDonaldTrump Then we're gonna make sure Bernie gets the nom, Trump. #FeelTheBern üî•"
Cruz dropped out. That means Donalds prolly got the nomination. We need Bernie more than ever. TrumpVSClinton is not something I wanna see üò¨
@Bernie_Facts Because he's the first candidate that speaks for the people and not the corporations. And because he fights for us.
"@goodbyethirdway Kinda feels like we've entered an alternate reality, doesn't it?"
@goodbyethirdway When Trump actually makes sense... üò≥

"@MT50000 And you agree with the lying, cheating and condescending points I made? You're actually OKAY with this?"
"@MT50000 Oh please, don't be naive.Voter suppression is high in all the states she ""won"".She is establishment and establishment=suppression"
"Me: *makes valid point about Hillary not being good as prez*

Them: SEXIST"

"@MT50000 Well I know you don't connect with youth by lying, cheating, voter suppression and condescending tones."
"It's so true though. Vote for Bernie, someone who actually connects with youth. #FeelTheBern #ImWithHer https://t.co/ccvxI8cx9o"
Obviously there was mass voter suppression in #NYPrimary . We still got more delegates than @POTUS did in '08 though. Don't give up hope yet

@pinchicagoo I'm pretty happy with my future career lined up for me. Who knows? Maybe I'll enjoy 15 cats.
Lady Liberty gets arrested during #DemocracySpring . Very symbolic for what's going on. Creds to @aletweetsnews https://t.co/2YtnH0MsPt
"@pinchicagoo tell me Paul, are you a woman?"
@pinchicagoo We're only miserable because ignorant twats like you seem to think you can dictate what we want and deserve.
@pinchicagoo Where the hell are you getting that statistic? More women are choosing careers over children now than any other time in history
"@pinchicagoo It's 2016, in case you didn't notice. We don't have assigned roles. We make our life what we want it to be..."
"@pinchicagoo Oh, pardon me. Didn't realize you still lived in the 1950's."
@pinchicagoo Women should be whatever the fuck they want to be. Same as everyone else.
