"@veggie64_leslie I have to admit I am very angry after yesterday, we have someone who wants to change all of this and hes losing #sheep"
"@veggie64_leslie @EmmeWinch I am sure they don't, they probably have the research to know exactly what to expect and in what sequence"
"@veggie64_leslie @EmmeWinch its horrible, its not right, I posted a tweet that 10,000 years of species extinction happened this century"
@veggie64_leslie @EmmeWinch I would love to see the look on the Kochs faces as a 50ft wall of water came crashing into their estate
"@veggie64_leslie I know this is their real plan to cure climate change, hunger, poverty, healthcare problems, let enough of us die off"
@veggie64_leslie @EmmeWinch If they can get enough of us to die off before its too late for everyone
"@veggie64_leslie @EmmeWinch I wonder if theyre preparing say the Kochs, even though they have people deny climate change, are they preparing"
@EmmeWinch @bad_bad_bernie @veggie64_leslie if earth ends up a baron waste land I wonder how well the elite will do without hired help lol
@EmmeWinch @bad_bad_bernie @veggie64_leslie their destructive greed will cause their own demise

@sonourable @Socrates090 @jexaminerai I agree anyone who has blatant disregard for life does fit the criteria
@Highcentered honestly I have not
"@GusTheTerror You are an extremely low form of life jumping straight into your middle school level vocabulary, not worth another tweet"
@GusTheTerror I guess you have not been paying attention to the hundreds of thousands who have had their registrations purged
