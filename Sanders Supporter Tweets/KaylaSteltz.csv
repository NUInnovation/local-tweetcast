Hey kids make sure you appreciate cool neighbors that you grew up with because one day they might move to an island and you will miss them
Today I woke up to Macey singing to me #blessed @maceymcgovern
Boys are seriously so dumb!!

@maceymcgovern  just hugged me and her tits look great
"I've now been in traffic for almost two hours and my radio stopped working, so now I'm just sitting here in silence 🙃"
At this point I'm going to be like an hour late. I should have slept in!!!
