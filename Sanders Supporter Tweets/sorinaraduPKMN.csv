@Byaaakuren me
"I just bought my flight to Pokemon Nationals, hope to see you there! #PlayPokemon"
@jparanada it's time to huff le puff
Must... consume... I really feel like I'm failing our nation cause I haven't bought anything in over 12 hours. 🇺🇸
I turned on the radio after four months and they're STILL playing that fuckin 21 Pilots song. 😒
"@EyeZayZay it's okay, we can test at Seattle Regionals..."
"@EyeZayZay you're right, that's something else I've told myself I would practice and have yet to start..."
"Oh, Seattle Regionals is two weeks away?? I think all of my testing plans are going out of the fucking window..."
The real problem is that I'm a huge romantic.
"Romania didn't qualify a women's gymnastics team for #Rio2016, despite having medaled in every Olympics since 1976. This breaks my heart."
okay
Only 3 episodes of #The100 left... I'm not super excited but I know 6 months from now I'll forgive the show and re-binge it before season 4.
@benpooter @MrFeedYoGirl I'm deleting my Twitter bye
"Freaking out about the fact that less than 48 hours from now it's going to be May 1st, which really blows my mind."
"@LJ_Wenger @daiyafoods I'm not sure, I think most of it is made out of coconut. It's really good though."
I've been missing umami a lot. Really gotta start cooking more. 💥
@EyeZayZay @lmwlms OH SHIT. VIEWS 4/28
I can't stop listening to Retro.
@MrFeedYoGirl thanks for bringing it to my attention via your post on BENFONTE.
"I'm trying to tell my dad that the @daiyafoods cheezecake is vegan and he won't believe me?? He's like ""lemme look at the ingredients."" 😒"
"I totally slept on STN MTN Kauai, my b my b."
"he only want me when i'm not there
he better call becky with the good hair"
@lmwlms @comcastcares lmao there are no read receipts for Twitter DMs.
"In a showcase of extreme pettiness, I now want to wait until 4/29 to pay my @comcast bill b/c the wording on the bill is WRONG and ANNOYING."
2. Why does my bill state that I have an overdue balance when the due date is 4/29? That only serves to freak me out @comcast @comcastcares
1. Why did @comcast bill me for 4/29 and then immediately again for 5/16? Changing the bill date is actually a big deal. @comcastcares
"I can already see my future, it's just going to be a lifetime of me getting mad at @comcast and yelling at their sad customer service reps."
"I'm so mad at myself rn, this is like the 5th time I've left my food at home in the past week or so. 😡"
@lmwlms goin up
I woke up really stressed out. 😔

@lmwlms sssshhhhhhh
@lmwlms I'm in only if there's a high chance he sings Aaron's Party.
"I responded to something my manager said over our work IM with ""lmao."" I hope I'm okay guys, I don't know what this means."
"When you're the next person in line at @ChipotleTweets and and the person in front of you says, ""I'd like 5 burrito bowls please."" 😒"

I should get a minifridge for my room lol.
@CalamariMAX GET IT
Not working Mondays feels like cheating. ☺️☺️
It's amazing what your body can do on only one hour of sleep. It's amazing how much more your body can do on only one hour of sleep.
@kwisdumb 😷
@lmwlms yeah he is! @RichardGao23
@raxvulpine haha it's all good. It's cause I just replied to it today.
@raxvulpine ahh it's all good. Thanks tho. Just learning to not apologize for myself anymore.
@sorinaraduPKMN I realize now that the correct response to this problem is probably not egging ppl on. I just don't care anymore tho.
Also why can't the camera function on the @twitter app zoom in?? Who invented this???
"OKAY if you need to ask the Starbucks barista for a list of all the sandwiches they have, DON'T go to the drive thru https://t.co/L2kjzrBfFH"
@MrFeedYoGirl nowhere near basic enough.
@MrFeedYoGirl of being a basic bitch? What's your Starbucks order??
@MrFeedYoGirl HAHA you chose well.
@MrFeedYoGirl why did you tag me? lol
@MrFeedYoGirl if only 😌
@MrFeedYoGirl lmao I was up packing
Getting up at 7 am is so easy when you don't go to bed the night before.
@hcurfman I need them!!
"Yes, I played Night March. Like I said you should! https://t.co/0dslypRYRU #PlayPokemon"
"Hear more about my BC Provincials top 8 by listening to my podcast w/ @kwisdumb, Experience Share! https://t.co/0dslypRYRU #PlayPokemon"
@doeiqts @Official_PAX you should come out for it!
@ageguyera21 perhaps a pile of Wheat Thins...
@kwisdumb @carneasahdude I think they were wheat thins!
lol??? https://t.co/kvzGOb6TN2
"@AlexCharmander @runGoodlife they might be, idk. Night March causes real suffering."
@runGoodlife you're honestly right though that PTCG Hell me is the worst me. Lord.
@runGoodlife ever since I went vegan and started playing Night March I've become the true scum of the earth. 😔
"Thought I wouldn't be able to go to @Official_PAX this year b/c of my extended Worlds trip, but it looks like it's a bit later this year!"
"The Britney Spears song that goes ""mama I'm in love with a criminal"" applies to me because I'm very much into guys that look homeless."
I just believe in spreading the love. 🌷
@lmwlms hahahahahahaha this is exactly how I feel
@queerpupper I love you ☺️
@queerpupper yeah I don't like purple dildos either. :/
"@Meeaboo @Spotify hahaha it's not bad, but definitely not as good as the download or the phone app. 

https://t.co/NnGaGjKB0j"
"@Meeaboo @Spotify sweet, thanks! My point was that Spotify should add the function to their browser app. They have it on their phone app."
@Meeaboo @Spotify I mean I can just do it on my phone but that's against the principle.
@Meeaboo @Spotify YouTube has never had an auto-repeat function. Can I create a playlist with just one video on it?
"WHY IS THE REPEAT ONE SONG FUNCTION NOT AVAILABLE ON @SPOTIFY BROWSER??

HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO LISTEN TO SLOW JAMZ ON FUCKING REPEAT????? 😡😡😡"
"imma bring the cool whip, then I want you to strip 👌🏻"
@kwisdumb YES. Also hyped for that.
"Someone at Vancouver Provincials said I invented ToadBats. That's not true, but we take those. #PlayPokemon"
The movie I'm most excited for this year is easily Passengers.
@natakazam awh I'm so sorry.
@ChaosJim1 @SixPrizes it's actually because of the 96 hour pay period and moving to a place with 1/2 the rent.
I've figured out how to do everything I want: just get ANOTHER credit card with a several thousand dollar credit limit. Problem solved. 💥
I'm actually not running low on money for the first time in what feels like months. 😌
My favorite use for the iPad is kitchen TV. Kitchen TV is one of the best inventions.
Remember when lmao meant something?
@raxvulpine I really like it and it was great melted in the sandwich. I have to try the other flavors too. It wasn't even that pricy!
@ProbablyTy hahahaha depends. I think vegan cheese is junk food tho.
I should stop eating junk food tho! 😂
This is a #vegan grilled cheese sandwich using @FieldRoast Tomato Cayenne Chao cheese. It was so. good. https://t.co/vyI1EpFxQz

@YoFizzYT @Nugget397 &lt;33
@YoFizzYT like I'm worried anything I do will be seen as attention-seeking or will give guys the idea that I want to be hit on.
"@YoFizzYT @Nugget397 thanks, it really means a lot that you're speaking out. I hate not being able to do things b/c of the label I get."
@YoFizzYT @Nugget397 at the same I have seriously considered quitting just to no longer be bothered by it. 😔
@YoFizzYT @Nugget397 I agree. Also at that point I guess I'd just have to never leave my house.
"@SummerPlesko but yeah, there's a ton of pseudoscience all over the place haha. Going vegan w/o soy can be hard for sure."
@SummerPlesko here's a better source - https://t.co/PSldA1pp90
@Nugget397 true.
I LITERALLY SMILE IN A GUY'S DIRECTION AND THEY THINK I WANT THEIR DICK INSIDE ME. NO. I WANT QUIT POKEMON B/C TOO MANY CREEPS.
@kwisdumb I'm really sorry for being a shit on Twitter despite having just complained about it. 😏
"@kwisdumb I would argue that she's not a ""specimen."" 👀"
"@CSBeachy yeah. I've just been getting a lot of ""soy is bad for you!"" bs from people recently."
@CSBeachy which is why I'm not on the beach smoking cigarettes right now.
"@CSBeachy I mean, I understand where you're coming from, but it is true that eating a healthy diet decreases your risks of certain cancers."
.@sorinaraduPKMN you also need to be eating like 12+ servings of soy a day to get man boobs so don't fear.
Please stop telling me to not eat soy. https://t.co/NUCslTu2cT

The most outrageous thing I've heard recently: a hot @Starbucks venti latte only has two espresso shots in it. ☹️
@sorinaraduPKMN it's like another Goofy movie or something
Last night I saw F. Murray Abraham (Homeland) and Susan Misner (The Americans) on The Good Wife! #showscollide #ishouldstopwatchingsomuchtv
@sorinaraduPKMN LMAO The Goof Wife I'm t e r r i b l e
@benpooter I love him. He was also on Grey's and on Weeds for like two eps.
Really like every actor from every other show I watch is on The Good Wife.
@benpooter yaaaaaas 🌿👌🏻
@benpooter lmao why are you still watching?
@LibertyFigter that's a great reason to discount EVERYTHING he says 😜
"@LibertyFigter yes! I just discovered it too, it's awesome. 💥"
It's just funny to me that people continue to push animal products as having unique nutritional benefits when they don't.

If @BestCoast's Crazy For You isn't an accurate reflection of me then nothing is.
@ChaosJim1 this does apply to Pokemon as well! 😉
@filleflore @kwisdumb malnutrition in bees may be one of the causes of colony collapse disorder. Partially caused by taking bees' honey.
@filleflore @kwisdumb bee keepers can still have a profitable trade w/o people eating honey.
"@filleflore @kwisdumb it's actually impossible to eat anything without killing bugs/animals, the question is how to reduce animal suffering."
@kwisdumb I think it can be! This is all actually b/c I was watching some videos re: veganism / honey on YouTube.
@kwisdumb I think it's okay to use animal products if they were sourced ethically. This thinking also makes veganism more accessible. 😌
@kwisdumb and the question is - then what is the purpose of veganism? It's why I hesitate to call myself a vegan.
@kwisdumb some vegans argue that whether or not an action is ethical is irrelevant; if you're using animal products you're not vegan.
