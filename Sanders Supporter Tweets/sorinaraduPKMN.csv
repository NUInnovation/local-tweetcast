"I just bought my flight to Pokemon Nationals, hope to see you there! #PlayPokemon"
@jparanada it's time to huff le puff
Must... consume... I really feel like I'm failing our nation cause I haven't bought anything in over 12 hours. üá∫üá∏
I turned on the radio after four months and they're STILL playing that fuckin 21 Pilots song. üòí
"@EyeZayZay it's okay, we can test at Seattle Regionals..."
"@EyeZayZay you're right, that's something else I've told myself I would practice and have yet to start..."
"Oh, Seattle Regionals is two weeks away?? I think all of my testing plans are going out of the fucking window..."
The real problem is that I'm a huge romantic.
"Romania didn't qualify a women's gymnastics team for #Rio2016, despite having medaled in every Olympics since 1976. This breaks my heart."
okay
Only 3 episodes of #The100 left... I'm not super excited but I know 6 months from now I'll forgive the show and re-binge it before season 4.
@benpooter @MrFeedYoGirl I'm deleting my Twitter bye

@lmwlms @comcastcares lmao there are no read receipts for Twitter DMs.
"In a showcase of extreme pettiness, I now want to wait until 4/29 to pay my @comcast bill b/c the wording on the bill is WRONG and ANNOYING."
2. Why does my bill state that I have an overdue balance when the due date is 4/29? That only serves to freak me out @comcast @comcastcares
1. Why did @comcast bill me for 4/29 and then immediately again for 5/16? Changing the bill date is actually a big deal. @comcastcares
"I can already see my future, it's just going to be a lifetime of me getting mad at @comcast and yelling at their sad customer service reps."

@raxvulpine haha it's all good. It's cause I just replied to it today.
@raxvulpine ahh it's all good. Thanks tho. Just learning to not apologize for myself anymore.
@sorinaraduPKMN I realize now that the correct response to this problem is probably not egging ppl on. I just don't care anymore tho.
Also why can't the camera function on the @twitter app zoom in?? Who invented this???
"OKAY if you need to ask the Starbucks barista for a list of all the sandwiches they have, DON'T go to the drive thru https://t.co/L2kjzrBfFH"

"@AlexCharmander @runGoodlife they might be, idk. Night March causes real suffering."

"@Meeaboo @Spotify sweet, thanks! My point was that Spotify should add the function to their browser app. They have it on their phone app."
@Meeaboo @Spotify I mean I can just do it on my phone but that's against the principle.
@Meeaboo @Spotify YouTube has never had an auto-repeat function. Can I create a playlist with just one video on it?
"WHY IS THE REPEAT ONE SONG FUNCTION NOT AVAILABLE ON @SPOTIFY BROWSER??

@natakazam awh I'm so sorry.
@ChaosJim1 @SixPrizes it's actually because of the 96 hour pay period and moving to a place with 1/2 the rent.
I've figured out how to do everything I want: just get ANOTHER credit card with a several thousand dollar credit limit. Problem solved. üí•

"@YoFizzYT @Nugget397 thanks, it really means a lot that you're speaking out. I hate not being able to do things b/c of the label I get."
@YoFizzYT @Nugget397 at the same I have seriously considered quitting just to no longer be bothered by it. üòî
@YoFizzYT @Nugget397 I agree. Also at that point I guess I'd just have to never leave my house.

"@CSBeachy I mean, I understand where you're coming from, but it is true that eating a healthy diet decreases your risks of certain cancers."

@filleflore @kwisdumb malnutrition in bees may be one of the causes of colony collapse disorder. Partially caused by taking bees' honey.
@filleflore @kwisdumb bee keepers can still have a profitable trade w/o people eating honey.
"@filleflore @kwisdumb it's actually impossible to eat anything without killing bugs/animals, the question is how to reduce animal suffering."
@kwisdumb I think it can be! This is all actually b/c I was watching some videos re: veganism / honey on YouTube.
@kwisdumb I think it's okay to use animal products if they were sourced ethically. This thinking also makes veganism more accessible. üòå
@kwisdumb and the question is - then what is the purpose of veganism? It's why I hesitate to call myself a vegan.
@kwisdumb some vegans argue that whether or not an action is ethical is irrelevant; if you're using animal products you're not vegan.
