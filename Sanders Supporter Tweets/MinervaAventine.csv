@Maliheh_ That's who they're polling? Way to exclude young people.
@JordanChariton The time is now. Vote #NYC! The nation loves you! #PrimaryDay #BerNY #DemPrimary #VotingDay  https://t.co/Z8KIZRQrxK
"@jryangolden @JordanChariton ""not newsworthy"" is entirely subjective. It's #PrimaryDay! And claims re advisor are unrelated to this case."
"@jryangolden @JordanChariton Media's job: to report election news &amp; let people decide, not manufacture public interest w subjective content."
@sluggahjells Unthinkable for gov to be so unprepared given the expectations of high turnout. #NYPrimary #PrimaryDay #VoterSuppression
"@JamesFTInternet Suspicious at best, and under the watch of such a ""cautious politician"" with great judgement."
@sluggahjells Willful incompetence?
Assumption based upon an antiquated form of #feminism. #genderstereotypes determine sensitivity? #UsNotMe #gunsense https://t.co/OCE6otwYWb
"@politico So divisive to make ""everything a woman's issue."" Understand impetus, but trauma of #gunviolence doesn't discriminate. #UsNotMe"
@kilihn @arzE At this point the enemy is any judge/official who could open the #NYPrimary but doesn't. #DemPrimary #DemocracySpring #NYC
@kingcoos @arzE Disgraceful. How are we supposed to regard our gov when they treat the people as pawns? #NYPrimary #DemPrimary #Bernie2016
@illuminataly @jitka @arzE Manipulative tricks impinge on democracy. #VoterSuppression of free thinkers. #NYPrimary https://t.co/nJYaPMGMqI
"@StephenAtHome @HillaryClinton #Hillary could have a TV talk show if she loses the election. I wouldn't watch it, but I boycott TV."
"@DrTomMartinPhD @DailyNewsBin Well it's on FB, must be true. &amp; polls: spot-on. Caucus states &amp; disenfranchised Dems make no diff in general."
@davidsirota HRC just won't talk about gun sales by her SD? Won't even try to explain rationale? Much worse to treat us like we're stupid.
"@kept_simple @joanwalsh @deep_beige @cushbomb Isn't about womanhood, but claims of greed, grifting &amp; being for sale. https://t.co/WbAb99lrDB"
@Drew0rFalse Agreed. How can a non-brainwashed person evaluate ideology based on label alone? #HRCHiddenTranscripts  https://t.co/ZjbVyREVPi
@brooklynnygirl @JamiaStarheart What else should we think? No obvious gains to hiding them. Show me #HRCHiddenTranscripts &amp; prove us wrong.
Americans want to know what values HRC &amp; all Republicans uphold behind closed corporate doors. #HRCHiddenTranscripts https://t.co/PZiezNQKGz
@brooklynnygirl @JamiaStarheart Not one of the high paid speeches she wants to hide. Still need to expose #HRCHiddenTranscripts.
Guess it couldn't hurt to release the transcripts? #HRCHiddenTranscripts  https://t.co/HPIe9AiGpO
That's why it's on YouTube. #HRCHiddenTranscripts  https://t.co/it5gB76C5T
I wonder what else we don't know. #HRCHiddenTranscripts  https://t.co/lyseGtOFla
"Don't forget she handed over ""all the emails"" she didn't delete months after she was asked. #HRCHiddenTranscripts  https://t.co/TEjGkNhjV2"
How have you travelled to so many countries and not had bubble tea before? #HRCHiddenTranscripts  https://t.co/rdbUgn89cB
@INSANEPoliticz @amychozick Asian smoothie with tapioca balls in the bottom. Seems odd she's travelled the world and not had one before.
"Was wondering if Hillary likes ""squishies"" bc that's what we need in a presidential candidate. #HRCHiddenTranscripts https://t.co/NtpoRzckSI"
Enjoy your freedom on the Internet while you can. Next POTUS could shut this down. #HRCHiddenTranscripts  https://t.co/n83BdRMocL
#HRCHiddenTranscripts https://t.co/vts8m80lYN
Maybe Trump had the transcripts? #HRCHiddenTranscripts https://t.co/05FkmNh01W
Maybe they will believe what's on the transcripts.  #HRCHiddenTranscripts https://t.co/T0ICfR0Uoq
#HRCHiddenTranscripts https://t.co/rgJXbdPqoB
But we would know... yet she wants us to trust her as leader for all Americans.  #HRCHiddenTranscripts #HealNotHeel https://t.co/9GQfyPNQPm
"Of you're a real leader of all Americans, then what could go wrong?  #HRCHiddenTranscripts https://t.co/AXrLnDMzIV"
Me too. I want to be wrong in feeling that our lives are what the banks are consuming.  #HRCHiddenTranscripts https://t.co/oKHUtnX3Ql
Moral equivalence is a sign of weakness.  #HRCHiddenTranscripts https://t.co/OhzcswsVGR
#Hillary can be truly progressive on this one issue by being the first to be straight with the people. #HRCHiddenTranscripts
We the people would like to read the corporate speeches from all applicants for our POTUS position.  #HRCHiddenTranscripts
"If HRC releases her transcripts, it will give her leverage against Republicans who haven't. Unless...  #HRCHiddenTranscripts"
@HillaryClinton Do you even care a little bit if we trust you? #HRCHiddenTranscripts
"If you want to be a president for ""all the people,"" then you need to take note of what the people want and need. #HRCHiddenTranscripts"
