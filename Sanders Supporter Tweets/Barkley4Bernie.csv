@Jerbear423872 So you're going to let fear dictate the direction of our country? Maybe we'll end up getting to choose between Stalin/HitlerüôÑ
@Catiemay321 Hahaha @DWStweets you are the worst. @realDonaldTrump should forget about Muslims/Latinos and throw you and @HillaryClinton out
"@HillaryClinton Oh late it's called evolving when you do it, I forgot. My bad Hills!"
Unbelievable! Everyone knows the Clinton Cartel has a monopoly on backpeddling! How dare Trump even try?!? https://t.co/K199zUiVFZ
@Bernieforny2016 @Jerbear423872 LETS GET FUCKING NUTS! #BernieOrBust
"@Jerbear423872 I will not reward the @TheDemocrats @HillaryClinton &amp; @DWStweets for this minstrel show of a Primary. Enemy of change, ‚úåÔ∏è"
"@Jerbear423872 You realize after telling people they aren't a Democrat, Progressive, This that and the third, no one gives a flying fuck?"
"@AnthroLizzy @barbos2 @SenFeinstein Lol. Now, July, November. The answer will always be #NeverHillary #BernieOrBust"
"@AlisaandBernie @BernieSNewschan I live in Philadelphia, can't help so much in KY."
@STFUnwo @LisaMadigan @HillaryClinton You're not allowed to sue the evil villain from a movie it's against the law.

@GucciShade @KristinG70 @DanScavino @BillKristol If I didn't love Bernie so much I'd almost want Hill to win just to see her trounced in Nov
@HillaryClinton @gmater189 @roadtosingapore @WewillvoteTrump I wouldn't even piss on her if she was on fire.
I can honestly say this is the first time I've ever heard anyone that passionate about @HillaryClinton. ü§î https://t.co/bStdvinkXj
@UltimateTennis_ @SuperSpacedad She's that special kind of corrupt where the left and right hate her equally.
@HillaryClinton Are you sure benefits for rich people is a tree you should be barking up? You're like a walking billboard for the 1%.
"@ipikak1 @WewillvoteTrump I'll be there too, and I vote in Pennsylvania. Fuck Hillary for life."
@Jerbear423872 @WewillvoteTrump I will vote Trump in Pennsylvania absent Bernie on the ticket. I don't give a fuck.
@JustAGurLnSwedn @GopSux2 In fairness you're a fucking idiot so I suspect fictional premises upset you quite frequently.
@JonReinish @observer Hey you should just be happy you got mail! If you didn't mention Bernie's name I'd have no idea who the fuck you were.
@QueQuoi @MichaelSalamone @WoobieTuesday @noreallyhowcome @Deir_in_DC fuck @davidbrockdc I wouldn't piss on him if he was on fire.

"@AlisaandBernie @BernieSNewschan Lol, poor Sellus Wilder only got $10. I felt bad about that too giving all my donations to Bernie."
@Williamkellehe4 @shitHRCsays And someone needs to explain to her what the fuck dead broke is. So goddamn tone deaf.
"@Williamkellehe4 @shitHRCsays In the private sector, fine. But politicians taking office for profit has to stop. She is the worst culprit."
@babsiemay @PatrickAnhalt How could you possibly know that? Are you conducting the investigation?
"@davidallenward @kodamiyazaki Swear, every time I see @paulkrugman I laugh a little bit harder. Special kind of moron."
@STFUnwo @LisaMadigan @HillaryClinton $10'll get you $20 her investigation goes absolutely nowhere.
@STFUnwo @LisaMadigan Isn't this the lady who sued to stop Illinois late voting and capes for @HillaryClinton?  With friends like her...
@DWStweets Are you drunk Debbie? You're like the biggest sellout in American politics. Even Scrooge McDuck thinks you take it too far.

@dustin_temple10 I told you she was a gold digger an hour ago lol. I muted her ass right then and there. You have too much faith in ppl.
@OckyJ83 @dustin_temple10 @Pick6_ So kids don't get poisoned?
@dustin_temple10 @OckyJ83 @Pick6_ She outed herself as a gold digger.
@COMatBU SOLD!
@COMatBU For real before I put down this $400 deposit I'm trying to get a cute dog out of it!
@OckyJ83 @dustin_temple10 @Pick6_ You seem like a wonderful person.
@OckyJ83 @dustin_temple10 @Pick6_ I'll give you 100% of my reparations for a $1.
"@OckyJ83 @dustin_temple10 @Pick6_ If you're waiting on actual reparations as entitlements or whatever, it will never happen."
@dustin_temple10 @OckyJ83 @Pick6_ It really didn't work though. At least for Native Americans.
"@dustin_temple10 @OckyJ83 @Pick6_ I want criminal justice reform, economic equality, jobs and education. Those are my reparations."
@OckyJ83 @dustin_temple10 @Pick6_ My point that you missed entirely was I have no faith in any promise of reparations from the Govt.
@OckyJ83 @dustin_temple10 @Pick6_ I'm not going down that road where I shit on Native Americans bc I have it bad. That's Trump shit. ‚úåÔ∏è
@HillaryVictory @EmmaMoodyWSJ @WSJ Yeah Emma stop slandering poor Hills!
@OckyJ83 @Pick6_ @dustin_temple10 *emancipated slaves.
@OckyJ83 @Pick6_ @dustin_temple10 Are you not familiar with slaves being promised the land they worked to have property rights revert?
"@OckyJ83 @Pick6_ @dustin_temple10 No one did. I was being facetious. Last time reparations came up, it worked out so well..."
