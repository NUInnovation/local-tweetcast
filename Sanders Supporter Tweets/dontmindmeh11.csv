@LaPajamas @WeNeedHillary people's lives are not of substance at all! You're so right! Omg I'm a troll I gotta go back to troll school
@texdakota @ClayPerryMusic I don't think they need his help .. That's just a new cnn talking point. It's really a silly line.
@Minnie_Churl have a good day
@Minnie_Churl I can't help but notice I presented you with facts that you never actually addressed. That's why our debate doesn't matter
@Minnie_Churl I'm not a dem
"@texdakota @ClayPerryMusic yes the republicans, who want Hillary in jail and have hated her for 20 yrs, need Bernies help with a smear"
@Minnie_Churl like that even has a video. Again I said I watched the live feed yesterday. I'm not a conspiracy theorist. That is so rude
@Minnie_Churl https://t.co/2XHvzQnYfO
"@Minnie_Churl I can post links, too. And of course you think my facts are suspect ... That leaves us with nowhere to go"
@Minnie_Churl I am giving you facts that are not my opinion
@Minnie_Churl what about the recount in Chicago that proved the votes were off and favored Clinton?
@Minnie_Churl not to mention the exit polls and the probability that they were off by so much. It's statistically impossible
@Minnie_Churl HRC supporters don't care abt what happened in NY
@Minnie_Churl and yeah this voter suppression is gonna be a big deal in the general and don't come crying to the people you called crazy
@Minnie_Churl I said nothing about independents
@HillaryClinton #ReleaseTheTranscripts #DropOutHillary
"@HillaryClinton ""I believe marriage is b/w a man and a woman"" -Hillary Clinton #DropOutHillary"
When you go to put it #dropouthillary Twitter doesn't give it as an option. As If it doesn't have 112k tweets. Your bias is showing.
"If HRC is nom and there is voter suppression, Dems don't come crying to me. You called me names when I said it #dropouthillary"
@Minnie_Churl have you done any research into voter supp? I watched the live feed of NY BOE yesterday. No Hillary supporters
"@Minnie_Churl she's winning Bc of historic voter suppression. But go ahead and block me, paid Twitter egg."
@mill09 @therealPopeyS @benchmarkpol please show me where you got that info? That is nowhere to be found
@texdakota @ClayPerryMusic these are classic republican lines. HRC voters have become republicans. They don't even see it.
@ClayPerryMusic you gotta give the paid eggs some credit ... They try lol
@LaPajamas @WeNeedHillary you think Hillary has more integrity that Bernie? How many times has she 'misspoke' and it cost actual lives
"@mill09 @therealPopeyS @benchmarkpol who else is under investigation? Oh yeah, Hillary"
@mill09 @therealPopeyS @benchmarkpol not to even mention that NY and AZ are under investigation.
@mill09 @therealPopey Hillary made the same vote # argument to Obama and he rightfully told her its false Bc it doesn't count caucus'
@Ladybug014 that's not what Indiana said
@Minnie_Churl how come HRC has been the one with lower favorability ratings this whole time? 2nd only to trump. That's not Bernies fault
Voter fraud  #MyTopIssueThisElection
@HillaryClinto Hillary stole NYC
#DropOutHillary and #ReleaseTheTranscripts why don't you?
@kechallis @wildscenery @darkstar_x so were you also into Sarah Palin? I mean if we r forgetting policy and going only off gender
@kechallis @wildscenery @darkstar_x none of these ppl even use the language of modern feminism. It reeks of white feminism and it's gross
@kechallis @wildscenery @darkstar_x you guys wouldn't know what intersectional feminism was if it hit you in the face
"@kechallis @wildscenery @darkstar_x as a feminist, these cries of constant sexism from HRC ppl really drives me nuts"
@ScribeSlendy that would be the Dems uniting around #NeverHillary  lol
@Thomas_Conerty this is exactly how is Bernie ppl feel abt #NeverHillary
If you're  #NeverTrump then it's time to get serious about @BernieSanders
@TimBartender I just saw some bestiality porn they put in a fb group. I feel sick
I am seriously ill after seeing some bestiality porn that some paid trolls put in a Bernie group #BernieOrBust #HillNo #FeelTheBern
How can @CNN @nytimes @MSNBC survive after this election? Anyone 45 and younger won't watch anymore. They screwed themselves. I feel free
@JeanLR @WinSmarty @paulkrugman its not a rule that they decide b4 the race and the media includes them in a misleading count.
@DEEE999 @paulkrugman @GinsburgJobs if he just wanted money maybe he should start giving Goldman Sachs speechs
@TnGovern @tommorrison950 @paulkrugman wow you sound like republicans
It amazes me how all HRC supporters say the same 3 things. Either ur a robot or you only hear propaganda. That's how you get that way
Paul Krugman is the only whiny and divisive one I see around here.
@YMIPolitical the point is yes all lives matter but sometimes we are talking about black lives specifically and that's ok
@DarrelGOP @MarkDice I pray you find love and acceptance in your heart. Bless you.
@YMIPolitical https://t.co/k4VgOwX7MH
@YMIPolitical and this is going in a real All Lives Matter direction for me
@YMIPolitical that is exactly what I saw. What lots of ppl saw
"@YMIPolitical if Jehovahs witnesses and salmon eaters are oppressed then I am ready to listen w/o giving my own ""narrative"""
@DarrelGOP @MarkDice tell us more insight about the black experience!
"@Slate wow, Becky didn't get the joke"
@iamBungalow ikr because I need a panel and poll to tell me what I found funny
@YMIPolitical we need to see how the marginalized and oppressed view life so we can help them
@YMIPolitical but that's reality. We don't live in a world where races are equal. Ppl should comment on it when they have a platform
@washingtonpost @NomikiKonst @abbyohlheiser slay!!!
@YMIPolitical that's not what black people are saying
@DarrelGOP @MarkDice I guess they will have to start calling you for advice on class
@YMIPolitical they*
@YMIPolitical black twitter loved it and that didn't ask white ppls opinion Bc it doesn't matter to them. It doesn't have to.
@DarrelGOP @MarkDice so your point is that you can say it but a black man can't say it to anther black man? And that's YOUR decision?
@YMIPolitical if you didn't get it or like it then it wasn't for you
@YMIPolitical humor isn't meant to make everyone feel comfortable. He accomplished what he set to accomplish
@DarrelGOP @MarkDice I know you're jealous that you can't say it. But look you got your chance!
"@mdsbarry @thehill says FU, says stupid joke, doesn't respond to actual question"
@YMIPolitical not everything is for white people. It's gonna be okay.
@YMIPolitical actually if there is any way ANYONE would think I agree with you I'm deleting. Cannot risk it.
@YMIPolitical ummm.. If you think I agree with you then you are MISTAKEN
@mdsbarry @thehill what actual bearing does it have on anyone's life?
@mdsbarry @thehill bless you!
"@TrumpSuperFan @larrywilmore hot take, becky"
@mdsbarry @thehill it isn't that hard. But whatever bye.
"@mdsbarry @thehill if you can't understand, I can't help you"
@mdsbarry @thehill and anyone saying it to HRC would be rightly labeled a sexist
@mdsbarry @thehill clothes don't make a person qualified
And now @CNN is gonna mansplain the #WHCD
@mdsbarry @thehill what if someone said that Hillary's clothes were what made her qualified?
@thehill OMG this issue really matters to the American people! ... Wait? #WHCD
@HillaryClinton why it gotta be pink?
@HillaryClinton standing up to bullies is exactly why we are #NeverHillary
@HillaryClinton paying your female staffers the whole dollar would be a more sincere gesture. #NeverHillary
Also the  #BlockSalon hash tag is leading people to the article. It always backfires on them when they try to Internet
Man these ppl that want to  #BlockSalon couldn't survive a day of Bernie's media coverage. That shit was tame 😂
Can you imagine if trump spent a million on a super pac that ended up posting porn in fb groups? Ppl would be in jail rn #FeelTheBern
"Chris Matthews, I hope all your lies and pandering and money laundering was worth your wife coming in ""dismal third"" last night 😂"
@probIemchic @AlexSBillings didn't you JUST tweet that you're a feminist? Do you even understand feminism??
@probIemchic @HillaryClinton ...... As IF https://t.co/rM70wnOgvJ
@HillaryClinton pitch in a dollar so I can say my avg donation is low! #thirst #obvious
@peaceactionwest @TheBpDShow https://t.co/AS0gsbjrd0
@bobbyjett time will tell
@bobbyjett the math is that she has to win by 70% margins in upcoming states to reach the magic number
.@HillaryClinton is the one with Bro's! #MillionDollarTrolls https://t.co/dmzkeFU64i
@Jim_Barilla @SusanSarandon @MissyKrissy412 @CassandraRules Hillary is the only one with Bro's! The IRONY
@Arthur59611540 @niTWITbit @politico he IS unifying the country
"Damn guys, they are so scared of us. Of our message of peace and equality and justice. #MillionDollarTrolls #ImWithHer"
Facebook shutting down 5 major Bernie groups the night before primary #breakingbarriers #ThingsBernieHates
.@HillaryClinton trolls shit down Bernie FB groups and ppl begin massively donating to @BernieSanders #BernieorBust
Four major Bernie supporter groups gone. How's that #LoveAndKindness working out? @HillaryClinton #feelthebern
.@HillaryClinton told Bernie supporters she can do it without them. Good luck! You alienated a generation of Dems #unity #DemTownHall
@prakash74ca @BernieCanadians @BernieSanders his supporters have nothing to suspect about him and everything to suspect about HRC
"@prakash74ca @BernieCanadians @BernieSanders your avoidance of my question, answers my question."
@prakash74ca @BernieCanadians @BernieSanders I thought I lived in a free country. I didn't know you were King and regulated my speech! Gbye
*turns off @MSNBC * 17 minutes of negativity and bs are enough for me. Thx @BernieSanders for keeping it classy #DemTownHall
@prakash74ca @BernieSanders well he had the same job for those ten years .. So there's that. He has no $ scandal Vs clintons countless scndl
You can feel her condescension and that is why voters don't trust her. That's why we loved Obama. That's why we love bernie! #DemTownHall
"Hillary brings up NYdailynews fake scandal aaaand there goes honesty and substance. I want a pres w/o scandal, manipulation #DemTownHall"
@prakash74ca @BernieSanders I would think her ties to Goldman which paid more than his whole yearly salary are a bigger problem
@prakash74ca @BernieSanders what does one have to do with the other?
This is the most substance @MSNBC has had in months! Thank you @BernieSanders for keeping it about issues #DemTownHall
"For every tweet that says ""but HOW is he gonna pay for it??"" #DemTownHall https://t.co/682fjYF8FL"
@RoseFromPhila @HillaryClinton https://t.co/thSdxxsfmR
@RoseFromPhila @HillaryClinton https://t.co/RjItnGbU3O
@RoseFromPhila @BernieSanders @HillaryClinton he can't force them to
@HillaryClinton @ThisWeekABC let's all ask ourselves why Charles Koch wants HRC? How does that benefit him. Pretty obvious.
Shaun King blocked me and I do not know why! I love him so much! I am so sorry for whatever the misunderstanding was? I tweeted support 😿
@thehill these are the ppl that voted Obama in!
@thedailybeast @HillaryClinton https://t.co/7iNCvnkIbr
"@izzydanzer @Brendan_Surrey @HillaryClinton but I do want to say this has been a good and respectful convo, thank you!"
@izzydanzer @Brendan_Surrey @HillaryClinton and there is a candidate running on a platform that more suits my views
@izzydanzer @Brendan_Surrey @HillaryClinton my preference is for it to be done without fracking in the interim
"@izzydanzer @Brendan_Surrey @HillaryClinton Bc between fracking and coal, neither are good choices"
@izzydanzer @Brendan_Surrey @HillaryClinton which is bad. So I think we must begin NOW to phase into wind and solar
@izzydanzer @Brendan_Surrey ok my research has shown me that a ban on fracking DOES make us more dependable on coal immediately
@izzydanzer @Brendan_Surrey i cannot get the link you gave to load on my phone going to have to google
@izzydanzer @Brendan_Surrey @HillaryClinton I live in OK where we never had an earthquake and have them basically daily now. It's awful
@izzydanzer @Brendan_Surrey @HillaryClinton so you mean it will cause probs with economy or Mother Nature?
@ShaunKing @justinjm1 I love you Shaun! This is giving me LIFE
@izzydanzer @Brendan_Surrey @HillaryClinton have not seen these. Can you point me to them?
@izzydanzer @Brendan_Surrey @HillaryClinton okay let's say he did support fracking - it doesn't make it okay. Not okay for ANYONE to support
@ChelseaClinton @HillaryClinton yes that is why it is so important to ban fracking! Please say you will stop supporting/spreading this
HRC paid trolls be like  #StillSanders #BreakingBarriers https://t.co/Ea1P7TXBLR
@HillaryClinton @CorrectRecord do you pledge to not spread worldwide fracking? In honor of Earth Day
Sorry one more cause it's funny that they're spending so much money just to try to Internet. 😹 #feelthebern #ImWithHim #barrierbreakers2016
"Betty McElderry, ur support of  @HillaryClinton against wishes of OK makes voting against you an easy choice! Thanks! #barrierbreakers2016"
Because fracking shouldn't just be an American problem - it should be a worldwide problem! #barrierbreakers2016
Today I made the decision to cancel cable. I can't contribute to @CNN @nbc @ABC in any way anymore. 💪🏼
@TimBartender this is everything that I needed. Thank you so much
@txchick999 @MSNBC lol wow
@txchick999 @MSNBC you're so cool for railing against free education! How inspiring! I'm SOLD
@LeighMayo I don't think they are just looking to collect fees
@LeighMayo yeah but that's the general. If he wants to stay in primary and ppl support him - he should
@LeighMayo @taddevine @BernieSanders you may not like him or want to vote for him but his supporters WANT to send $ and support him
@LeighMayo why can't you conceive of someone doing something on principle?
@joanwalsh what a gross thing to say. Why don't you say what you're REALLY trying to insinuate
"@SunoftheM0rning @nytimes when I see you saying he did nothing in senate, i want to compare records. Nothing more."
@SunoftheM0rning @nytimes I never lol' at you or degraded you. And I apologize if you felt that way
"@SunoftheM0rning @nytimes you don't have to talk to my, calm down"
"@SunoftheM0rning @nytimes dude.. You're assigning a lot of ""perniciousness"" to me that wasn't on my end. I asked a question."
@SunoftheM0rning @nytimes sounds like we can't really have a discourse here.
@SunoftheM0rning @nytimes I never excluded any of her qualifications. I've only asked you a simple question
@SunoftheM0rning @nytimes I'm not framing an argument.. I asked an extremely simple question.
@SunoftheM0rning @nytimes you brought up his record as a senator. I was responding to that. Show me how she did better in senate
@SunoftheM0rning @nytimes I've asked you the same question three times and you can't answer ... You haven't swayed me
@SunoftheM0rning @nytimes trying to have a convo but you just want to make bold claims without backing them up
@SunoftheM0rning @nytimes I asked you about their records in senate. You haven't provided anything. You are wasting my time at this pt
@SunoftheM0rning @nytimes tell me about the bills she passed that were so great
"@SunoftheM0rning @nytimes I could link you lots abt his work in the senate, but you can google the Amendment King without my help"
@SunoftheM0rning @nytimes ok you didn't talk about what she accomplished in the senate
@SunoftheM0rning  @nytimes research his time in senate vs hers and it's not that complicated.
@jbouie good job invalidating all the people who broke records showing up for Sen. Sanders. They aren't real at all!
@davidsirota @goodbyethirdway @TishJames Annie Oakley is gonna stand up to the gun lobby!
@SunoftheM0rning @dbaker4203 @nytimes a simple wiki search disproves ur pt abt him not passing a bill.
@nytimes @nytopinion I hope none of you ever need any sanders supporters for anything ..
"@nytimes @nytopinion oh man .. I came just to read your mentions, NYT. Who you think you're foolin with this desperate crap?"
@davidsirota @goodbyethirdway Bernie made me a bro!
@Slate because if HRC met pope I'm sure it would be the same exact headline
"@Slate daaang what a joke you have become, slate"
"Imagine not being able to stand on policy and  #NotAMeeting was your effort to entice voters 😹 good luck, guys. Winning hearts and minds"
@dllynnnnn I mean I low key love when they try to start a hash tag. Always ends up hilarious
Y'all are trippin over here on  #NotAMeeting ... Dang. Your girl is winning... Ctfd.
