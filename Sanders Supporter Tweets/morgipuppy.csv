Packing my clothes was way easier than I thought it would be and I'm kinda disappointed lol

it makes me so happy that @allisonn_beck and I are both doin big things this summer üí™ 12 years later and we're still smart and tough af
I just slept for like 12 hours for no reason
Sean bugged me all day to come over n I was busy til now.. Yet he has a 10 page paper due tomorrow that he hasn't even started ??
