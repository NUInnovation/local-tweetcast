@BethAnnDavidson @therealmatt1975 @USA_Movement best way to help American businesses grow is to increase their demand

@jcpenni7k @jaxx613 @RoyCohnsGhost @USAneedsTRUMP do your research
@jcpenni7k @jaxx613 @RoyCohnsGhost @USAneedsTRUMP I do?
@sparkleemonster hey I didn't say trump should serve on his administration. I just said he most likely would listen to trump$ opinion
@sparkleemonster Hillary shouldn't even be allowed to hold office
@jcpenni7k @Racismliveson @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress yes I did. Spew less bullshit and you would have seen it.
@jaxx613 @jcpenni7k @RoyCohnsGhost @USAneedsTRUMP just like that
@jcpenni7k @Racismliveson @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress lol oh the irony is thick with this one
@Zoro_Mojica @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress ok.....and? I didn't ask.

@sparkleemonster I'm sure Bernie will listen to trumps advice when buisness is brought up.
@Racismliveson @jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonadTrump @meetthepress once she's able to hold a conversation respectfully I might talk 2her
@Racismliveson @jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress lol all I get from her is insults. She has no facts or proof.
@USAneedsTRUMP @PureNTrue1 @meetthepress @realDonaldTrump maybe trump should bring his business to America and provide some competition
@USAneedsTRUMP @PureNTrue1 @meetthepress @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/DqtO4Xen1n
@USAneedsTRUMP @PureNTrue1 @meetthepress @realDonaldTrump hope it's worth the price lol.
@USAneedsTRUMP @PureNTrue1 @meetthepress @realDonaldTrump flags are fabric. I feel the same way when they use the flag as clothing.
@USAneedsTRUMP @jcpenni7k @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress everything we rely on Mexico to make how are we going to get those items?
@USAneedsTRUMP @jcpenni7k @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress ok so he stops all trade with Mexico. In the time it takes to get America making

@USAneedsTRUMP @PureNTrue1 @meetthepress @realDonaldTrump that's only a hope of yours. His history says he wont
@sparkleemonster so make him an adviser not president
@sparkleemonster @AniesiODaniels no one forced him to take his business to other countries
@sparkleemonster @AniesiODaniels oh so the government forced him to go to Mexico and China while allowing others to remain in America?
@jaxx613 @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress he would rather get richer than create more jobs in America.
@USAneedsTRUMP @jcpenni7k @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress when in American history does trump want to take us back to?
@USAneedsTRUMP @jcpenni7k @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress or how he will pay to find and remove all illegal immigrants

@JAGApparelGroup @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress can you elaborate more?
@Barkley4Bernie @jcpenni7k @Beansiesdaddy @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress and did it without resporting to violence
@jcpenni7k @Beansiesdaddy @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress lmfao scurry back to your bridge now. Dora needs another rhyme.
@USAneedsTRUMP @jcpenni7k honestly If he doesn't get the nomination ill write him in. We don't need more wars
@jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP yes I did. I have answered every one of yours while all you know to do is insult. Typical trump/Hillary tactic
@jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP show me where you answered? All I see from you are insults and false claims
@jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress ironic you posting about a lack of solution when all your posts are insults&amp;slander
@jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress no you didn't. You just take the easy way and post insults. No facts no proof
@jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress another reason to support @BernieSanders. Higher class of conversation with them.
@jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress you still haven't shown any proof. All you have done is insult.
@jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress I had to sift through all your insults.
"@jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress 4 his history proves he fights for those who need it, 5 hes not 2 faced......"
"@jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress berntards?  Lmfao ok. 1 equal rights, 2 he supports the troops,3 hes not a biggot,"
@jcpenni7k @RoyCohnsGhost @USAneedsTRUMP again with the free stuff? Sad

@sparkleemonster @AniesiODaniels explain how
@jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress graduating with unsurmountable debt is bad for everyone
@jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress no shit keeping and creating jobs in America is good.
@ericmeyer45 @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress lmfao obviously lmfao that's why America is in the hole its in now
@jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress there you go again claiming its free. You really need to do your research
@jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress I'm not the one who's claiming it is free. You are. Get your info correct
@jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress voting Hillary/trump sure will
@jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress oooooooh so close. Try again
@jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress afford to pay it back

@Beansiesdaddy @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress you forgot to put the unicorns and Easter bunny in trumps la la land
@Beansiesdaddy @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress lmfao
@jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP lmfao. If you could actually show any kind of proof to support your false claims.....oh wait your a trump sheeple
@jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress lmfao you're one of the best trolls ive met so far. Even if ur tactics are outdated
@jcpenni7k @USAneedsTRUMP @realDonaldTrump @meetthepress lmfao I don't need one. I'm a veteran and I earned my G.I. bill.

@BobbyLew007 @meetthepress individual States would raise minimum wage as the cost of living goes up every year.
@BobbyLew007 @meetthepress and if we could trust the individual States to controle it properly they would have years ago.
@YahyaJohn @realDonaldTrump only because they want a woman president.  Sex isn't a qualification contrary to what Hillary says
@keksec__org @realDonaldTrump why vote for someone who needs to learn how to act presidential when we have someone who doesn't need lessons
@ringod01 @AniesiODaniels @Patrickesque @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/zmC75CYFmw
@ringod01 @AniesiODaniels @Patrickesque @realDonaldTrump hes been telling you what you want to hear just like his equal and friend hillary

@rpjohnson001 @TheMelaninPlug @Canada4Bernie ive seen bowl hair cuts before and now I can say I have seen a helmet haircut
@QuitYerBitchN @BernieSanders that power statement is also why I refuse to vote or support trump. He acts like a person on Jerry Springer
