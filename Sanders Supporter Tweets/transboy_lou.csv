@mars_collective yeah kinda. I'm the same way tho
So it turns out I have a crush on a guy so I'm not 100% aromantic and I'm kinda having an identity crisis right now help
"Can someone like, come over here and chop my boobs off with a kitchen knife? Please?"
OH MY GOD  https://t.co/g591k3g8G6
Ugh
ALSO binding my chest fucking sucks on my period because my boobs get swollen and tender
Ovaries are screaming at me and there's blood coming out of that hole
"But then add dysphoria on top of that. Most of the time I try to forget I have these parts altogether, but that's hard to do when my"
"the cramps and gross clumpy blood coming out of my body, and the awful hormones that put you in a bad mood. That's just normal period shit"

@realDonaldTrump I would like a small loan of a million dollars to pay for my and my friends' transitions

@thiem_park @MeghanWMcCarthy so you don't believe that survival is a human right
@thiem_park @MeghanWMcCarthy yeah because I'm just so awfully entitled for thinking that survival should not be something you have to 'earn'
@MeghanWMcCarthy everyone deserves the healthcare and food necessary to survive.
"@MeghanWMcCarthy health care is not a trophy, it's something people need in order to survive."
@MeghanWMcCarthy there's a difference between free health care and everyone getting the exact same thing no matter how hard they work
