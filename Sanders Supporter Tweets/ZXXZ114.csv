@davidsirota @TNWomen4Bernie @IBTimes They were probably paid to be angry at you
@Shadz66Shadz6t6 @NewyorkWeissman @America2_0 This is why Bernie can win as a 3rd party candidate
@JordanChariton @TheYoungTurks Even more Reason to believe as a 3rd party candidate @BernieSanders would beat both Trump and Clinton
@Merton_G3 @NewyorkWeissman @People4Bernie @HuffPostPol When Independents can vote he will beat both Trump and Clinton
@NewsRadio930 @TheBradMielke 60% of Americans would support a 3rd party candidate.  The time is right for Bernie.
@RoseAnnDeMoro 60% of Americans would support a 3rd party candidate.  The time is right for Bernie.
@RoseAnnDeMoro If Bernie is running in November?  He will win
@RoseAnnDeMoro If he let's the people know he won't let them block him. Donations will start pouring back in.He needs 2 be open to 3rd party
@RoseAnnDeMoro Bernie needs to see this is the moment.  He can't let the obstructive establishment block us.
@SamHolloway1 @JeanetteJing @GreenPartyUS @DrJillStein I don't like the term leftist. How about Socially Progressive?
@NewyorkWeissman I truly believe if he is on the Ballot in November? He would beat both Trump and Clinton.
