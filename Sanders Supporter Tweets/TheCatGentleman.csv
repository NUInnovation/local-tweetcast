@MyersNFL @justicar Damn
@MyersNFL @justicar How fast are your speeds?
@1077TheEnd @ByTimBooth @PearlJam Oh
@ByTimBooth @1077TheEnd @PearlJam I would like to know as well.
@RJeffQ I'll bring the screwdrivers and a level!
This was a frustrating day all around.
"@JoeVeyera I see your point. Then yeah, let's get that over with so we can move on."
@ProspectInsider @ttvrdy @eric_d_williams Let's do this.
@JoeVeyera I honestly don't see how it can be with the nightmare traffic/parking issues already there.
@Gaychel22 @ICC_00 lol They're such a waste of money. And I feel like dirty scum when I walk in to one
@ICC_00 I hate strip clubs.
"@zjwhitman @tibbsaf After it was voted down by the public, of course."
Cause the traffic situation in Queen Anne is the picture perfect scenario! https://t.co/znMA7ukciQ
"@jazzorion @SeattleCouncil Take away what we want, while forcing what we don't down our throats."
"@jazzorion lol You crack me up, man."
@cydniecr Kale chips are a great snack.
@_eimmiK And you're entitled to them. I'm curious to know why.
"@antmay A lot of truth to that. I expect an outsider to screw us over. You shouldn't have to expect your local government to, as well."
@_eimmiK Why?
@jazzorion That would at least explain a lot.
@SeattleJ213 @MommyUnit We still do.
@alexSSN @SeattleCouncil All your friends would call you a dumbass. Cause that's what you'd be. A dumbass.
@jazzorion @SeattleCouncil Exactly. Gentrifying a business section of the city? They should worry about the residential parts.
@GersonLevy @ICC_00 @SeattleCouncil Let's. I'd love to go take a piss on them.
City council is supposed to listen to the people. @SeattleCouncil clearly did not. And the reasons they gave for a no were BS.
"@JaredStanger It's ridiculous, man. Can't say I'm not surprised, unfortunately."
Thanks a lot @SeattleCouncil for ruining a chance for us to bring a lot of good to the city of Seattle. I hope you get voted out.
@JaredStanger Oh sure you can. Plenty of real estate in the area for a new arena.
That doesn't sound good.
@Gaychel22 Same.
@dhodgs @jazzorion @ChrisDaniels5 @SeattleCouncil Touché
Hold your breath people.
@jazzorion @ChrisDaniels5 That's what I don't understand. Nobody is losing their freaking job over this.
@jazzorion @SeattleCouncil They should go check out the gentrification going on Rainier Valley if they really care about that.
@JoeVeyera I can't afford to live there.
Went to check out a room to rent. Landlord was 30 minutes late. After confirming I was still showing up an hour before our appointment.
@JoeVeyera https://t.co/Acv9NBUsYm
@JoeVeyera @Ourand_SBJ Oh gross
@JenniferDolin It was fun meeting you too!
@_DrunkViking @JohnPersak Wouldn't rhat be nice.
It is so gorgeous out in Seattle right now.
@Almae1 Just a little lol But I'll be okay.
@Almae1 Well this changes everything!
@JoeVeyera I feel Bagshaw used the MOU as a way to get re-elected. Knowing she wouldn't follow through with it afterwards.
"@Almae1 I do assume your avi is you. If so, that would count as a picture of you on here."
@Almae1 lol that's kinds funny.
@DevolutionMan @TBpnw @PearlJam They're amazing live.
@TBpnw Adorable. And I see she has a mane of her own.
I still can't believe science thought homosexuality was a mental illness.
"@TBpnw Yeah, @PearlJam what's the good word?"
@TBpnw @PearlJam Have you heard any Seattle dates yet?
"@dhodgs @nikrox21 lol I guess if I didn't have much human interaction too, I'd share those observations that you did."
Rachel Carson is my new hero. First person to speak out against pesticides. And pissed off Monsanto while doing so.
"@dhodgs @nikrox21 Lovebirds, eh?"
"@antmay @TBpnw Seriously, man. I can't do it anymore."
@nikrox21 @dhodgs Not a bad idea.
Watching The Sixties brings out a lot of emotion. Watching people fight for a better life for those that follow them is inspiring.
@nikrox21 @dhodgs /sigh Yeah. I might go to the game on Sunday after though.
"@nikrox21 @dhodgs Oh lame. I work the next day, I won't be going. My brother will be there though. His gf's birthday."
@_eimmiK Damn
@nikrox21 @dhodgs Yeah
@nikrox21 I just wanted to make sure.
"Watching those words of hate used on television, news interviews, from government officials, is just sickening. And it wasn't that long ago."
"@nikrox21 You my damn was in support of your feelings, right?"
@nikrox21 Damn
"@old_sgt @ICC_00 hah he does, doesn't he."
Starting up the Civil Rights movement episode of The Sixites. Looking forward to the next 80 minutes.
@MsNatalieHughes @Q13FOX Oooooh I'm shaking in my space boots.
@gopikashine @EmrgencyKittens haha holy cow!
"@DevolutionMan @walottery Well, yeah. I am."
@isthataspider I thought so too.
"@kellouieNW You've been waiting all day to tweet that, haven't you."
@isthataspider Amen
"@DevolutionMan @walottery Just opened it up, working fine for me."
"@TBpnw Wait, do we get a choice? I'm going to be upset if I find out I had a choice this whole time"
"@JoeVeyera Weird, I just went there on Friday."
@DevolutionMan @walottery Mine worked fine Friday and today.
Ugggggh
@shanehall31 Barely.
"@ICC_00 Not sure if he was. Maybe he went on his own. I dunno, sucks."
@ICC_00 Shouldn't have been sent.
@cydniecr Great throw. Cano was out easily.
Fuck. What a throw.
"@McLovinDenise @TheDrtyChinaman Great picture, horrible beer."
"Let's do some damage here, guys. Make 'em pay!"
"Jack one, Cruz."
Damn yellow hydroplane.
@gopikashine Been saying that for years. And maybe you should have set us up better for success. Especially with the cost of college.
@JenniferDolin Hey that's us!
@JenniferDolin Headed that way
@JenniferDolin Where at?
@JenniferDolin You here? Just walked in.
@_MissNomer I don't put anything past any of our government agencies.
@nikrox21 SETTLE DOWN!!!
"@nikrox21 Just an observation, settle down."
@nikrox21 Oh nice! And no lol
@_MissNomer You're surprised they'd do this?
@nikrox21 Oh you were at the game?? Awesome! Sure are hitting Seattle up a lot lately.
@jazzorion @CT_Nationalist @benjancewicz Oh wow. Just give them the award now.
@gopikashine @EmrgencyKittens Hahah!
@isthataspider Thanks!
@isthataspider I like wearing shorts all the time.
@JenniferDolin @ICC_00 Nice seats!
@JenniferDolin @ICC_00 You better!
@ICC_00 @JenniferDolin Center field. Just cheap seats. 193
@JenniferDolin @ICC_00 @larryseahawker Go Ian! I'll be there!
"@kellouieNW Damn it, Science!"
"@kellouieNW But I look forward to getting blamed, in case it doesn't happen."
"@kellouieNW Oh it's cool, I don't believe in jinxes."
"@TheDrtyChinaman I think that's exactly what it is, especially at home."
@TheDrtyChinaman lolol
Looking forward to being at Safeco today for the Mariners first sweep of the season. #GOMS
A Yankees ad was just promoted on my TL. Marked as offensive.
@antmay @jazzorion I've been exploring for the past 15 years.
@jazzorion @AP I hate the media.
@CaloriesProper I stand by my feelings.
@TK421M Contrats to you both!
"@MommyUnit @dhodgs @somuchashley Nothing beats a cup of strong, black coffee. I miss it dearly."
@CaloriesProper I wasn't referring to people who gained a bit of weight.
@josephmuldoon I've watched that before. It's hilarious.
"@MommyUnit Good job, MU!"
@dhodgs hahah
@nikrox21 You were on TV?
@CaloriesProper @AnAnole1 I was 360lbs. I didn't need surgery. I just needed to change my lifestyle. But I get that some people do need it.
@CaloriesProper @AnAnole1 Just my personal thoughts. I'm glad it's there for the people that really need it. I also think not everyone does.
@dhodgs @A_Kowalski @davidfarland @urru_urru @broadbandtrends That looks pretty neat.
@tinasimms2 @OMGFacts I wish that was in driving distance to go see in person.
@Gaychel22 @JenniferDolin hahah
@tinasimms2 @OMGFacts That is so awesome!!!
@Gaychel22 @JenniferDolin I wasn't going any further than that lol
@JenniferDolin @Gaychel22 lol it's a bit more complicated than that.
@JenniferDolin @Gaychel22 Not this time 😕
@JenniferDolin @Gaychel22 It sucks.
@Gaychel22 Well I wasn't going to tweet that out! Then everyone would know what I just.....didn't do hah
@Gaychel22 I thought of this as I was typing it out. But I just half sneezed. Not the other thing lol
Nothing is more unsatisfying then not being able to complete a sneeze.
@dhodgs I can see why.
"I want one, or five. https://t.co/wIM2TYsTsb"
@isthataspider @dhodgs I've seen them all and read a few of the books. And I still vote for Dave's.
"@isthataspider @dhodgs Yeah, way better than mine. Dave wins."
@dhodgs @isthataspider https://t.co/aqTaUniKzT
@isthataspider @dhodgs lol good selection.
@isthataspider @dhodgs I can't see Samsungs either.
@isthataspider @dhodgs Probably an emoji we can't see.
@isthataspider @dhodgs Blank for me.
@isthataspider @dhodgs #conspiracy
@isthataspider @dhodgs Yeah...I'm sure it was nothing you did.
@dhodgs @isthataspider Typical.
@deanyo @Mariners 👊
@isthataspider @Mariners I don't believe in jinxes.
@isthataspider What's the temping offer? I don't see the Mariners offered anything.
"What a start to the season, @Mariners #GOMS https://t.co/ogU8MDmOno"
@isthataspider @Mariners I think you forgot something.
Way to go Miley! Way to go team! 5th series won IN A ROW!!
@TK421M Very true.
@MarinerMojo55 He's going for speed.
@Gaychel22 @ICC_00 Yes.
@THEOGCatfish You don't get to root for them in the playoffs.
@Gaychel22 @ICC_00 The wave is the worst thing to happen to sports.
Boo this man! https://t.co/JNz8PT0RR0
@JenniferDolin Hey alright!!
@JenniferDolin Oh dear god. I hope they don't do that tomorrow. I don't want to see that shit.
@kellouieNW lol touché
@JenniferDolin Uhhh what?
@kellouieNW I don't see anyone else around here.
"@kellouieNW Quit killing my joke, Kelly!"
@TK421M @DevolutionMan I'll try to remember tomorrow.
@JenniferDolin @TK421M @DevolutionMan Don't encourage him.
@TBpnw I hate that feeling.
@RyanDivish @PugetSoundLX @tfabian13 I like this idea.
"@TK421M @DevolutionMan 😒 They work there I think and park it on the grass, jerk."
@TK421M @DevolutionMan Dude there's a vechile at this gas station on Pearl I keep meaning to take a picture of for you.
@TK421M @DevolutionMan hahah
@JenniferDolin @TK421M And it all comes together.
"@DevolutionMan @TK421M It's party time, man."
@TheCatGentleman Damn it. This was supposed to be a response to @TK421M 's losing streak tweet. I hate my phone.
https://t.co/U6ifmQ7e2C
This dude really wants to see the pitch up and in.
@dhodgs Without the question mark.
@dhodgs This is your best idea yet?
@Co_Jack253 Apparently not.
Holy shit that was scary.
"Oh thanks for stealing my take on Smith's slide into first, Blowers."
"Okay, that's the first acceptable slide into first ever in baseball."
@JoeVeyera @dhodgs I don't care for him. He makes regular plays sound like the greatest ever. Just like Sims.
@DevolutionMan @Almae1 Like meth.
@dhodgs Aaron is Dave Sims Jr.
"@TK421M @_out_door_ @space_needle Thanks, I enjoy it."
@TBpnw Ballard is one big hipster.
@_out_door_ @TK421M @space_needle View from my balcony. https://t.co/somcYxj3dk
@JenniferDolin @Gaychel22 https://t.co/A8R7t8zMEC
"@kellouieNW No, just for eating."
Get it? Berries. Jam. I'm so funny.
Frozen mixed berries is my jam.
@DevolutionMan I need to check that out.
@TX_Seattle_Girl Ask him to move to a different TV.
@DevolutionMan I've never been on that specific ferry ride. And I've lived here my whole life.
@DevolutionMan That'll be fun!
@JenniferDolin @TheDrtyChinaman @ICC_00 @MommyUnit Nice!
That's okay. Cano's got this.
