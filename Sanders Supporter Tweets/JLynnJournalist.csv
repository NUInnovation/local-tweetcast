@eelawl1966 @domedomika1 All those connections with Panama Papers tax dodgers plus Clintons own Delaware tax havens. So American!
@theCCR @EdgeofSports Vision  &amp; courage plus an astute mind fighting 4 justice 4 all. Michael showed how 1 person can make a difference.
@BernieJourney16 Be safe
@vegans4bernie @saracohennyc   Clinton and principles in same sentence is definition of an oxymoron.
@manamohana @BernieSanders Wonderful!! What if we could try meditating at the same time??
@Artists4Bernie  Looking for artist to do collage to illustrate article about the election (pro bono). Pls contact me DM or otherwise. Thx
@Elect_Justice @JordanChariton what is EJ's response to the huge number of denials? Do you know the grounds?
@Bernie_Facts is this kind of fixation to avoid reporting in #ElectionFraud and what matters now?
"@SamSeder A legal giant who was really a political activist! 
Huge loss but ripple effect  immense. Condolences to Ellen and Rattner family."
@SandiBurkhart In some states that will negate your down ticket votes. Check rules in your state. Work to elect @BernieSanders now.
@NoMoreDon8 @Angeria7777 Be sure to check your registration B4 dropping off your ballot
@MSNBC @Bernie_Facts @BernieSanders  Where was Andrea Mitchell's reporting on Clinton Fnd laundering op as she traveled world w/ SOS HRC??
"@MSNBC @Bernie_Facts @BernieSanders Just as @BernieSanders took on Former Fed chair Greenspan, he confronts AG's wife, HRC buddy,/MSM host"
@TerminatorBarbi @saneprogressive @nicolesandler Debbie a powerful job making key pts  abt corrupt HRC/Dems. U named 2016 election: psychop!

@ND4Bernie Must stop #electionFraud b4 more primaries stolen.ppl w/evidence (black box tampering) must reveal it NOW
@Elect_Justice why EJ should post at more than one place. Where are daily tweets and postings on EJ website keeping voter/public informed?!?
@TheBradBlog Thank you for including the polling showing @BernieSanders winning over Trump. Most polling &amp; media ignoring Bernie's candidacy
@PatsCSW @HillaryClinton Guess Clintons failed to factor The Atlantic would report on their corrupt laundering practices
@HAGOODMANAUTHOR @_DylanChambers You mean like the disappearing Rose Law firm files?

@ldbrillante @aworkingpoor @Bernie_Facts @MLevineReports could be there is an intersection of money laundering and private email server
"@vegans4bernie thx 4 explaining. Seems senseless with so much at stake. By the way, I learned today most liquid D3 is lanolin from sheep."
@vegans4bernie Do u know why the trolls troll and then block u? What is the purpose? What gain? Seems counterproductive &amp; waste of time
@vegans4bernie @Hsvlinda thx VFB for supplying the facts but I fear denial is more than a river in Egypt
@manamohana yes. I see. Is there an overlay of the IN map of green/blue votes 4 HRC/BS with where there R/not machines?
@_michaelbrooks @majorityfm I don't care anymore what MR talks abt. Ppl have moved beyond MR obsession with Nov and HRC instead of NOW.
@Glertsgal @AAPIforBernie @Bettz49 Lorri I am talking abt the Dem primary

"@GerrishLisa @MikeHersh @Salon actually, a Democratic in name only"
@SethAbramson R U extending @maddow prof courtesy in her one-sided coverage of Dem primary. Real SD story: who non-gov SDs are (lobbyists)
@JordanChariton @librab103 @BernieSanders @HillaryClinton Do HRC SD feel tainted abt this kind of corruption by DNC/their party = them
@JordanChariton @librab103 @BernieSanders @HillaryClinton Looting and laundering! Glad  @BernieSanders campaign calling out HRC corruption!
