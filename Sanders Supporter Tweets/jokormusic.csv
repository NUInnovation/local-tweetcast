@BernieSanders for prez; @drjulianbell for gov; @Kevin_Stine for senate. #ORPrimary
HRC supporters have clearly never watched #HOC . We don't need a Frank Underwood in the White House. #StillSanders
"Big media be like ""Sanders would be an easy winner against Trump in the general... LOL JK THE DELEGATE MATH IS AGAINST HIM"" ðŸ˜‘ #StillSanders"
Don't believe a word of the pro-HRC media. #StillSanders https://t.co/JGj6g4kDA7
Sanders Seen As Strongest Candidate As He Crushes Trump In The Polls https://t.co/LWKm4WSaXY # via @HuffPostPol
I'm getting sick of all of the right-angled manipulation and Sanders-shaming. None of us should apologize for what we believe. #StillSanders
Perfect... #StillSanders #Bernie2016 https://t.co/SuwJzkCpSe
Bernie's victory will be all the more meaningful b/c he's had to fight a war on two fronts: establishment Dems and neocon GOP #StillSanders
"Whether or not @SenSanders wins this election, all of us true progressives must remain united in a coalition to bring the change we need!"
https://t.co/w3sPLiDWPZ
"Article floating around implies that not voting for HRC if she gets the nom is ""white privilege""... Thoughts? #StillSanders #FeelTheBern"
@lizzysk8tr and most get paid peanuts to do so! :P
Some reassuring math: https://t.co/9CunpcJETZ
Feeling accomplished now that #iVoted for Oregon's primary! #ORPrimary
"Hey OR voters, want a great alternative to Gov. Brown? Check out @drjulianbell and what he stands for!"
In the 21st century we should be working to contribute meaningfully to society - NOT working just to survive #basicincome #ubi
"A basic universal income would benefit freelance artists, who then wouldn't have to forcibly make art just to survive #basicincome #ubi"
The media keeps releasing articles saying it's over for Bernie. Not if the West Coast has anything to say about it. #StillSanders
"If @SenSanders loses the nom it will only confirm that our worst fears are very real - corruption, election fraud, etc. #StillSanders"
"If HRC gets the nom she won't win the general. It's SHE who needs to back out, not @SenSanders . #SuperTuesday #StillSanders"
You know this election is important when most of the voter suppression is coming from a supposed LEFT-WING candidate. #StillSanders
"So investigations into voter fraud are happening, good. But will that give the disenfranchised a new chance to vote? Or do we just forget it"
"Just googled ""who won the #DemDebate "". Articles not feat. reader polls said HRC; those with polls said @BernieSanders . Hmmmmmm"
Gettin' real sick of Sec. Clinton using Pres. Obama as a crutch for her rebuttals #DemDebate
The Democrats Are Flawlessly Executing a 10-Point Plan to Lose the 2016 Presidential Election https://t.co/ZyXEFC46hI # via @HuffPostPol
...And first VP of Polynesian heritage. Plus she's awesome in general!
"Soooo anyone else thinking @TulsiGabbard for @BernieSanders VP? 1st woman VP, 1st VP from HI, military experience..."
"One headline I saw read: ""Clinton says Sanders' proposals too far to the left"" ðŸ˜µðŸ˜¡ https://t.co/3PkVekFExY"
"Can you say ""propaganda"", kids?... Maybe it's just coincidence though O_o #Bernie2016 #FeelTheBern https://t.co/SypBLJowxi"
How the hell can you call a state for a candidate with less than 10% results reporting??
"Rubio out, eh? Wonder what Trump offered him...or threatened him with"
Stop changing our clocks! @OregonGovBrown @RepBonamici @RonWyden @BlumenauerMedia @SenJeffMerkley
"Love how Clinton literally said she wouldn't support fracking if states or cities said they weren't into it, not because it's wrong"
"Social justice without economic justice to support it, is like trying to ride a bicycle with two flat tires."
https://t.co/khoyuic5sD
"I actually voted ""no clear winner"" since I thought. both HRC and Bernie gave good performances tonight https://t.co/nIXMPXP8ii"
360-degree videos continue to fuck me up
"I completely agree that it's time for a woman president in the USA; however, Sec. Clinton is not that woman."
I'm personally willing to have my income tax increased by a few percentage points if it means free healthcare for all #Bernie2016
"@SenSanders = wise, loving grandpa; @MartinOMalley = best friend's cool dad; @HillaryClinton = rich neighbor who's nice but kinda scary"
Saying that PP is part of the establishment doesn't mean you want to get rid of the essential services it provides to women #Bernie2016
I'll be surprised if even 5 people get this joke... #FeelTheBern #neilbreen https://t.co/gbsUDIfIuA
So Trump is holding a rally in #burlingtonvt today... Having trouble coming up with a scenario where that would be a good idea #Bernie2016
Success!!! The Sanders campaign will have their access to the voter data network restored tomorrow! #FeelTheBern
Exactly. If this doesn't happen at tomorrow's #DemDebate it will expose Hillary and the DNC. https://t.co/EyT6E5V5FR
"Foul play on DNC chair's part. This sort of dirty trickery is somethings you'd expect from GOP, not a high-ranking Dem!! #dumpdebbie"
