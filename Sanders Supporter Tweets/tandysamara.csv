I can't believe Mississippi Governor would actually sign #HB1523. That was a pretty hateful thing you did @PhilBryantMS.
@andrewbiskupiak @IAmBethanyHi @DMabashov @BuzzFeedLGBT I was thinking of Bethany too you got to her first 😍
What?? What about the child's language acquisition and equity? Stop this language deprivation madness #AGBellLies  https://t.co/KwfU1G512L
"What?? ""I Want You to Hear"" resources. Really? What about I want you to have an access to language? #AGBellLies  https://t.co/KwfU1G512L"
I #lovebeingdeaf because snapchat is deafinitely #Deaf-friendly! #WhyISign and tweeting about #AGBellLies ✌🏼️
Is there even a 'right' time? No better time than now. Let's push for a positive paradigm! #DeafGain #AGBellLies  https://t.co/uPwl43Z5yK
I #lovebeingdeaf because there is no communication barriers within my #Deaf family [thanks to #ASL!] #AGBellLies
"@tweetingala I wonder what they're doing about this... Monday, they get back to work today don't they? @AGBellAssoc we r still waiting on ya"
@MicahTraurig @tarjaness 😘😘
I #lovebeingdeaf because it has given me a lifetime worth of loving &amp; staying true to my identity. Embrace your #Deafness! #AGBellLies
I #lovebeingdeaf because #ASL is a true definition of 3D language &amp; how everyone has their own signature via #ASL! #AGBellLies
"We're tired of being oppressed in the society by organizations like @AGBellAssoc, enough with #AGBellLies. We will not remain in silence."
#lovebeingdeaf because we all are thriving together in this society ~ from every aspect of the world ❤️ expose &amp; repel #AGBellLies
"I owe it to #EHDI2016 for my involvement with justifying #AGBellLies because there's no 'better' time to see ""For Deaf by Deaf"" than now"
"#lovebeingdeaf bec of what #AGBellLies wrote, we all came together unifying with facts and excellent resources &amp; shared them away!"
"#LoveBeingDeaf because the Deaf community has my back, and I have theirs too #onelove #OurDeafCommunity #AGBellLies"
@LealaHolcomb hmm yeah let's stick with both hashtags!
"#LoveBeingDeaf because of the network database all over the world, wherever I go, #Deaf people are there too!"
@vansjourneys poor thing!!! 😱
"@starrymountains @jonazmc we live in a world full of fallacies, don't we? #whitehaton"
Excellent letter!! Waiting on @AGBellAssoc for long overdue ethical and inclusive dialogues... 👀 #AGBellLies https://t.co/ohsdDW0mNC
@Alanna_Kilroy waiting for you to reply back to @seanmaiwald &amp; @LealaHolcomb ...
@dylanthinks_ @fuckeveryword I was thinking the same!!!
@lisarati why are you so dismissive of Deaf people? Just like you're so dismissive of ASL? I see how you're sweeping all of this under rug 😔
"@braamjordaan @AGBellAssoc I'm also thankful for social media, especially @twitter for giving us our voice 🙏🏼"
It was humbling to see plenty of Deaf/ASL signers all over the world coming together to call out @AGBellAssoc for their #AGBellLies.
@abcohende @AGBellAssoc wow this is amazing! Beautiful piece of art!
@MicahTraurig @AGBellAssoc never too late ;)

"Did I see anyone dismissing English as a natural language? Why are you dismissing ours, @AGBellAssoc?#AGBellLies"
"As a responsible Deaf citizen of the US, I will not let #AGBellLies continue to slay our DDBDHH community. I will not remain in silence."
@AGBellAssoc what to do if your #LSL concept fails? These kids will have no access to any form of language? That's language deprivation.
@AGBellAssoc time for y'all to stop belittling ASL. You're reinforcing the whole language deprivation experience of many Deaf people.
"@AGBellAssoc: ""However, it is just one such option and its use is declining."" Please do share the evidence. I'd love to see it. #AGBellLies"
