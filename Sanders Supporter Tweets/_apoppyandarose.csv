@YoungPPL4Bernie üò©
The tide is changing: I am part of that inevitability.
"The time is now to ensure our children will be able to compete in a global economy, have clean water, and not decades of unending war."
"Healthcare as a right. Democracy is for the people, and corporations are not people."
"I'm proud of who I stand with and what we stand for. Workers rights, fighting climate change, protecting civil liberties."
"For the love of God, STAY IN LINE @Bernie_Facts #notmeus #wearebernie #NYPrimary"

"@myannakoureas @yogrrt @realDonaldTrump I get so mad when he says he loves ""the Latinos"" and that he EMPLOYS many of them."
Perhaps the reason @BernieSanders does better in Caucasus is because it is harder to fix than electronic ballots. #ArizonaElectionFraud
"#BernieMadeMeWhite that awkward moment when you have to ‚úÖ a box 4 race ""white (non Hispanic)# and I don't know where 2 ‚úÖ, but u know u Bern"
