"""omg did you dye your hair?"" 

Nah fam I finally just washed it"
Will be watching social media all day long so I don't miss buying blink 182 tickets
Always remember who actually cares and who is just curious
Had a dream that I only had time to answer 20/200 exam questions so I was frantically filling in bubbles lol fuck this semester
@Patrdom haha but really the University never cancels class so this is a miracle
My kind of goodmorning text ❤❤❤ https://t.co/JenOWQavNe
CAMPUS POWER OUTAGE STAY STRONG SO CLASSES ARE CANCELED ALL DAY
Called the SW department to ask when the BSW decisions would be made but then they asked for my name so I quickly hung up and died inside 🙈
"Bullshit you fucking miss me. There I said it. 
I guess I'll talk to you in a few months."
Colorado I need you. Two more hours.
Hi if the social work department could let me know if I'm accepted or nah like no big deal I'm just trying to plan MY ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE
"Forgot my coffee thermos in the most busy lecture hall 😭 
goodbye."
Anything written by Cosmopolitan makes me cringe
"And in the end, we only regret the shows we didn't go to 😭"
"But I just laid there in protest, entirely fucked.
It's such a stubborn reminder, 
one perfect night's not enough."
@madiriotgirl also preserved his contact identity because he told me he'd wreck me if that photo surfaced on the Internet
The real mvp of life is friends who let u bitch over the phone for 6 straight hrs bc ur working a nightshift alone https://t.co/XUteBhOuab
You're the reason why I can't listen to the same songs I used to
"@rxchrd spring 2016, the semester that my flawless GPA went to shit. rip though. Gone but not forgotten."
@AshlynGerrard you have made my day 10x better and it definitely needed to be turned around
@AshlynGerrard you are bae 💕❤👭😘 I love you lady
People have just been stressing me the fuck out today.
@noimjory nice
@noimjory I don't get it
I was honestly dead inside because I couldn't get to The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus this weekend bc of the snow but they postponed it so 🙌
Was really really looking forward to going to Colorado this weekend but the snow is going to ruin my happiness once again
Waking up and being emotionally sucker punched in the gut. Fucking a man why do people suck.
🌈sorry mom🌈 https://t.co/tdEzNN3I7y
Ain't nobody got time for passive aggressive behavior. Bye.
When someone who told you they didn't want a relationship gets pissed when you start seeing somebody else https://t.co/eqmWoslL9p
When every second of everyday you question your life decisions lol can I be done with my twenties now
"Four more weeks. Just four more weeks..... 
😣📚📑🚫"
"The one day that comes every year that every women dreads.
The gynecologist."
Going to the Democrat caucus and seeing every tinder match you've ever had.
I seriously need friends in Laramie. Or to finally move to Colorado. And I definitely prefer the second option.
In need of human interaction
4 out 5 clients have woke up tonight what is this
@jeliohernandez luv u bby
@jeliohernandez is on my timehop literally everyday. Blessed to have had his friendship and savagery for too damn long ❤❤❤
When you've been at work for 20 out of the last 24 hours but you still have to get an education 😭
I'm so glad I quit working at Walmart before they started Walmart Radio 😂😂😂
So weird how time flies right by when you are actually happy and healthy and achieving goals and feeling excited about the future 😊😊😊
My BSW application fee hasn't went through since Friday so I haven't been sleeping at night good times
"Advising week, the real dead week because you realize your future dreams are slowly dying."
Forgot my gym bra rip to my tittes / everyone's eyes
Lol if a fight could not break out in this house every 15 fucking seconds that would be great. Jesus woke up today fam show some respect.
@Nicholannister Tru. I'd probably be living at the state hospital if I still did.
72 hours is farrrrrrrrr too long to be in Evanston.
So tired but I have to wait for this fucking laundry 😑
You know you've been on a diet for far too long when everything you scroll past on your newsfeed looks like fries🍟
Tom Hansen is my spirit animal
When ya trying to study for your anatomy exam in a few hours but there are so bomb ass rom-coms on all night at work
Hate the snow because I can't drive to Cheyenne for work but also sweet bc I don't have to go to work but also I'm poor 😑
Haven't had my teeth cleaned since I started college and I've put my teeth through so much shit in recent years gonna cry if I have a cavity
Warped tour 2016 lineup hauls 👍👍
"Isn't it strange, that every time I look at your name I'm suddenly high. 
For you to feel the same, I would do almost anything."
Man if I could go back and restart this past week I would it was nothing short of amazing

"Tonight was one I'll never forget. 
Blown away."
I fucking love TWY shows in Colorado because I always see the same people
Love/hate relationship with take home exams ya feel
Apparently I become Edward Scissors Hands when stressed because my chest and arms look like I was mauled by a bear
Ugh I just have to get through two more night shifts and two more midterms and then it's SPRING BREAK YES SO MANY SHOWS GONNA LOSE MY SHIT
It will physically pain me to drive all the way to SLC to stand in the nasty ass Saltair but I guess I will if that's the way this goes down
When I get paid my new life mission will be to find tickets Brand New at Red Rocks.
"I just did two weeks worth of homework for my online class and spent $150 bucks on concert tickets. 
I need to go back to fucking bed."
"Running around in circles, the path I always choose. 
I hate that I can't accept anything more, than the worn out soles of my shoes."
"No life, really. What the fuck else can you make go wrong. I'll wait."
10 miles outside of goddamn Laramie in a snow storm waiting for an accident cleanup is really just the icing on top of the fucking weekend 👍
Driving through a rainstorm listening to Copeland is just foreshadowing my whole life
@btbamofficial for the whole tour? 😭
