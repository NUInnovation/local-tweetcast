"@womanINtransit @NYDailyNews what do they mean when they say ""Yet it is expected to certify the April 19 primary results Thursday.""?"
"After voting,there should b a tally on the county website w/ a voter ID# &amp; then show the totals.That way we know we were counted #voterfraud"
"@PhroydsWorld , the schadenfreude in me wants to see her go down so bad, but I do have to let go a little bit. I have a little obsession"
@PhroydsWorld key words in article : CNN reported.......totally disqualifies the article IMO
