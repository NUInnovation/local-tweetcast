@sarahfdavis280 @dismed90 @TdotKdot What baseless smears?
@writeinbernie @Quicksilver2723 yeah... Gotta watch out for those subliminal messages!
"@magic_Montafon apples/oranges. I think the more 'establishment' one is, the more likely there's corruption. They don't seem progressive"
@magic_Montafon But I suppose even a progressive could be corrupt.
"@sarahfdavis280 @TdotKdot  Go ahead and tell me specifically what is clueless. Empty insult, no info. Who is clueless?"
@DaveKelley6 yup. I think many of the millions who voted 4 her must feel foolish now.
She's testing America. When is enough enough from this person? https://t.co/LgQKqXG0yt
@scout_lisa @NicoleJeanLTL @jaflowers2 @PMNightlyNews The foundation absolutely should be audited and NOT by junior level staff.
@scout_lisa @NicoleJeanLTL @jaflowers2 @PMNightlyNews Prime example of why it's better to have government provide programs rather than NGO
@NicoleJeanLTL @jaflowers2 @PMNightlyNews I'm sure it's all as crooked as a dog's hind leg. 😀
@NicoleJeanLTL @jaflowers2 @PMNightlyNews  You are correct! I haven't researched the foundation other than very superficially.
"@i314159265 @jaflowers2 @NicoleJeanLTL @PMNightlyNews I used to do audits of nonprofits, but not foundations."
@i314159265 @jaflowers2 @NicoleJeanLTL @PMNightlyNews I'll take a closer look at the information to see what he bases his conclusions on.
"@NicoleJeanLTL @jaflowers2 @PMNightlyNews I believe it, but this particular source seems shaky without another confirmation of fraud"
@jaflowers2 @NicoleJeanLTL @PMNightlyNews I'm a bit skeptical about this one.
@PSmirn @Pozervations @prg100740 Depends. He does not want trump or GOP majorities. Should campaign for reps&amp; senators.
"@get_enlightened @Quicksilver2723 @MissouriNewsUS They seem so desperate for $, I wonder if they need it for paying blackmail demands."
@farronbalanced @CamelotGypsy She's not going to get mine anyway. But it's EZ to mute or block.
Thank you! https://t.co/7aDjPo52Gd
"@SilERabbit @CamelotGypsy If they had given Bernie any coverage the first 6 mo of campaign, we would be done by now."

@dawnsaffron The crowds genuinely LIKE him. We can see the * person* while HRC seems such an empty shell without personality. Affectations.
@dawnsaffron I just saw a tweet referring 2the yuuuuge crowd @ Bernie's rally tonight.Thought about a certain affection for him. Personality
"@CamelotGypsy @Grandmaz4Bernie @democracynow And the poor thing seems to actually believe she found herself. Or, maybe not. 🙄😀"
@AntiWacko @namodassa @NomikiKonst that would require 43% of the country (who are independent) to let 50% of the country decide the GE cand
@AntiWacko @namodassa @NomikiKonst Nah. A voter should not have to choose membership in a private organization in order to participate
@Grandmaz4Bernie @CamelotGypsy @politico Same here. I recently said the same thing. Just the sound of her voice brings it on.
@Deir_in_DC @CBSNews Brings up the judgement problem again. She didn't know what should be marked a such?
"@JenD1974 @MSNBC the dirty masses, you know."
"@cascamike Brian must be looking quite like a pretzel trying to twist that around. Elections s/be fair, 1 person, 1 vote. Not rocket science"
@BernieVolunteer Maybe the rest are split among several other candidates. There's Jill Stein and Gary Johnson probably others.
"@blazed2blaze Yes. If you look at the corporate reports,they even include notes in the financials about whether election year (revenue bump)"
@tzbauknight Yes. Follow the money as they say.
@Mirabai305 Thank you!! @tinapayson @BernieSanders @DWStweets

I just signed a @progressivekick petition: I Agree with Bernie; What Do We Stand For? Sign here: https://t.co/hnK6XBPVUX #FeelTheBern
@jetreahy @tovangar2 @ThankYouBernie Better check another source. That's insane.
@Yfiv3 @Quicksilver2723 @get_enlightened I'm in West Hollywood. Haven't seen anything but Bernie stuff here.
@LivingOnChi I must have most of them blocked or muted already!😀
"@NicoleJeanLTL I haven't seen such hateful people this side of RWNJ, so that's right where they are in my mind."
@NicoleJeanLTL Seriously. Maybe it was a drunk tweet. Didn't even make sense. How is that 'privilege?' Stupid.
@CamelotGypsy @JeanetteJing She is hard to like. So snide and arrogant. Ugh
MSM doesn't like Bernie threatening to reduce their political advertising revenue via campaign finance reform. https://t.co/A13mp5tzpH
"@CDZ_999 @GodlessNZ America, don't be cruel. Don't force us to hear that cackle for four long years. I'm begging."
@NicoleJeanLTL @JoyAnnReid Would love to hear what they would call it if SDs flipped for Bernie in Philly! 😂😂😂
"@NicoleJeanLTL @JoyAnnReid Just a talking head, not a journalist. Not a smart one either. Made no sense. Privilege? smh"
"@novenator Since she feels she's got the nomination bagged, why not? Openly courting them for $, going all in GOP. #NotHillary"
@Bohemianmoon Exactly.  @Quicksilver2723 @3caratsice @HillaryClinton @BernieSanders

@KgKathryn @MalyndaNyc @SYounessian Right. List 3 things other than speeches.

"@HillaryClinton @BMLewis2 @realDonaldTrump No, I'm a Democrat who thinks Hillary should not be nominated."
@devinedianakins @LindaHusser @relombardo3 But the number is correct. It's just that Hillary won't have enough either.
"@devinedianakins @LindaHusser @relombardo3 Yes, that's what I said. It didn't all fit in 140. 🙂"
"@mattyebresnen @Ziggy_Daddy True. But,if she public ally lies about them and attacks them personally,it doesn't make her the poster feminist"
@JoAnnDwyer5 @Biblebabble The most recent hissy fit was about HRC's role in the illegal military coup of Honduras &amp; policy re child refugees
"@RepAdamSchiff Please support Bernie Sanders. We know HRC is not good for us. If you assist her, you aren't either. https://t.co/gVX9HKa6Hd"
@truthtotweet @maddow @pushforward2014 @ImRooneyArnab Anything since Flint? Maybe her last hurrah.
Hillary will be 'interviewed' by the FBI. How many of her supporters feel 100% certain she won't lie &amp; get caught? That's the situation.
"@LizzieSeesRed @DannyEFreeman @cidelson @BernieSanders 15,000 is what I've been seeing."

"@KING_IS1 I really don't want to insult people, but damn. It is amazing to me how they think they are so clever parroting stupid stuff."
"@LindaHusser @GodlessNZ Well, thank god we didn't get stuck with Palin."
@KING_IS1  Glad I have that person on mute. Out of patience.
"@jinyll That's just unbelievable isn't it? At least, I used to think so. The Oakland &amp; NY pepper spray cops, though. Ugh"
"@KING_IS1 @Tristanshouts @ThankYouBernie Nope. A 'review' is the preferred term, I believe."
@LindaHusser Definitely. Lots can happen between now and July. FBI. 😏
@KING_IS1 @Tristanshouts @ThankYouBernie They trust HRC knows what she's talking about because they R clueless. Now we have 2 stupid parties
"@KING_IS1 @Tristanshouts @ThankYouBernie They are clueless about issues, that's why they go ballistic when we try to discuss."
@KING_IS1 @Tristanshouts @ThankYouBernie They think they're talking politics when they talk smack about the horse race aspects. Absurd. 🙄
@LindaHusser She would need to win 74% and she won't.
"@LindaHusser @relombardo3 Because Hillary can't get enough pledged delegates either. It will Bdecided at the convention,so more deleg matter"
@jinyll I just hope it is peaceful. That is our position - peace.

@shaundakin Gee. Wonder if I can guess who one of your clients is.
@mobygrapefan @Libertea2012 She's all about big business. Corrupt. What difference?
"@mobygrapefan @Libertea2012 Not sure the orange clown would worship at Netanyahu's feet. On war, she's definitely bad. Fracking, too."
"@mobygrapefan @Libertea2012 No argument here. Most act shocked to hear that, but the differences are superficial at best."
"@mobygrapefan @Libertea2012 I know. I started the election cycle w/hold-my-nose attitude for her. After few weeks, it was #HillNo !!! 😮😱😨😰"
"@mobygrapefan @Libertea2012 She is so disgusting in so many ways, it's mind boggling. War. Money-grubbing. Liar. Fake. Opportunist. Creep"
@MattHoffmannnnn I'll vote for Bernie in the CA primary and hope he makes it to the November ballot. One way or another. FBI.
