"Goddamn, I'm gonna take the water taxi next week, this is ridiculous."
Maybe they reopened the viaduct :V
"We're taking a detour from the detour, heading back towards downtown!"
The bus driver has informed us that there was an accident on the rail line so we're stuck for now.
"Okay it was just regular traffic before, but now we're DEFINITELY stuck waiting on a freight train."
Now I think we're waiting for a train to pass? I can't even tell.

"After that's done, it'll be like this all the time. The tunnel is a waste of money that isn't even an adequate replacement."
It's galling to think that they closed the viaduct so that the tunnel can safely be dug beneath it.
Jesus christ the bus was a half hour late and we still haven't gotten out of downtown.

Some nen users even have goofy looking spirits that show up when they use their powers!
Nen has all sorts of rules but it all boils down to your personality and there's no real limit on its power.
@poik007 that was several hiatuses ago!
Stands can do whatever because fuck you it's magic. It's based on the personality of the person but there are no rules otherwise.
Like they have to go on and on about the types of nen and different contacts for basically the same effect.
All the crazy rules lawyering with nen just feels like an overly complicated version of stands.

He can't draw a dog to save his life but the man can draw the hell out of a human eye. Especially if it's getting stabbed or cut or crushed.
If Araki is consistent with one thing (and it probably is only one thing) it's drawing people with eyes that are almost too perfect.

"This way there can be, like, a normal difficulty curve."
I can only imagine how many people went the wrong way in DS1 and got destroyed by skeletons or ghosts. That's not a fun experience.
"Like, the areas are big and you can go down different paths within then, rather than going to completely different zones."
"The lack of nonlinearity in DS3 is a little disappointing, but it is also absolutely a good design decision. Especially early on."
The cathedral is probably my favorite area so far. Really captures that specific medieval mood and element of cautious exportation.
How can you get anywhere in any souls game and not be certifiably paranoid about ambushes at all times. Doesn't make sense.
Like I find the regular enemies that are big and fast and aggressive annoying to deal with. But the ambushes in the cathedral? Pffffffffffff
"I'm still not used to, like, being good at a game that most people find hard. I'm always on the other end of that."
It's always funny to read about people having trouble with things that you just breezed right through.

"Bleh, I need to get a new job. I love my current one but it just doesn't pay well enough : ("
My early PC rqgs are like Fallout or even older shit like Realms. The ones with real time combat never hit with me.
I didn't like Pillars of Eternity but that's because it was a nostalgia project aimed slightly off from my childhood.
It's so nice when a kickstarter game turns out good. The only real disappointment I've backed was probably Banner Saga.
Like it looks like it was practically a romhack of Link to the Past at first. Now it's practically unrecognizable.
It's funny watching the Hyper Light Drifter pitch video because they clearly threw out all the gameplay mechanics except the dash.
So beating your head against a difficult bit feels like self improvement rather than just gambling.
That's one area where HLD is really similar to a souls game: it feels fundamentally fair.
