@realDonaldTrump You're a fucking idiot!

@Thom_Hartmann And by multiple I'm referring to legit parties. And I do agree we need to have proportional representation.
"@Thom_Hartmann We have BernieOrBust &amp; Rep.'s saying they won't vote 4 Trump  (Bush's, Romney). Is it not the right time 4 multiple parties?"
@realDonaldTrump What a dipshit!
@WritingVirginia @HEINSLERJAN She must be referring to the mountains of Weapons of Mass Destruction.
@pbcqt @davidsirota Hell she called it a business opportunity!
@davidsirota @HEINSLERJAN @kombiz @aravosis And apparently it matters that you're white too.

"@GeorgeDunham He will sing a song with Luke it's called ""Drink a Beer"". He wrote it and sings background on it. Will also sing with LBT."
@harveyjkaye Here's a moving segment from @Thom_Hartmann explaining exactly what our founding fathers did sacrifice! https://t.co/qeIollzQvS
@kasie Not sure why they keep saying presumptive. He's running unapossed in remaining states. Collects every delegate. He is their nominee!
"@davidsirota @BlueNationRev So they're admitting her own record hurts her, but they turn around &amp; say she's best candidate? Hurts my head!"
"@_metafizik @MotherJones That's obviously ""what Jesus would do""!"
@ZaidJilani @weeklystandard Not only moving to the center but trying to pull in GOP moderates. What a disgrace to true progressives!
Bernie has proven over &amp; over. In states where EVERYONE is allowed to vote he wins! Do the Dems really want a nom. that can't win pop. vote?
"""Bernie, you just won Indiana by 5 points. When are you dropping out?"" The MSM is so goddamn corrupt! To hell with them!"
@ZaidJilani I think we knew too much of him!
"@cnn Hillary leads ""hey let's focus on this Dem race"" Bernie leads ""hey let's focus on Trump and Cruz"". Douchebags!"
@thomhartmann TPP is spamming twitter now! Unbelievable! https://t.co/sr7FV4X0bg
@Trade4America Fuck off you lying pieces of shit!!
"I find it funny that Bernie slaughters her in caucuses where votes are visible, but is somehow losing states where you can't prove the vote!"
"@dan_labbe @terrypluto @clevelanddotcom Man! Kessler is 6'1"". These dudes are massive!"
Today is your day Indiana! Let's show them how we do in an open primary! Get out and vote! Especially you Independent Bernie supporter!
"@CC4Future @BenJealous @thee_stupid @BernieSanders @rosariodawson Watch ""Where To Invade Next"". It's how most of developed world does it."
@CitizenSullivan @mizladyjayne @fawfulfan @BenJealous @BernieSanders @rosariodawson The other 5% must B all the wars she voted 4. He didn't!
@NormsClubhouse @SportsSturm If Car pick of Worley confuses you just think that they gave up their 3rd 4th and 5th to go up and get him!
@GeorgeDunham But what has Alabama ever done?
@_metafizik @glennbeck @RightWingWatch I think the more the reality of Trump sets in the more orange he gets!
@NathanZegura @kardiackid33 Exactly. Obviously we wanted a no doubt franchise QB. But after that WR was top need. We got the best one. SMH
@cdotcombrowns @clevelanddotcom No!
@Canada4Bernie @mnewsince @ZBanshee I was 1 who was going 2 vote 4 her. After all the voter suppression &amp; dirty tricks I'm writing him in!
@drewpelto Oddly enough there's still a ton of Alabama on the board!
@drewpelto I'd stay pat now and go Jack if he's there or Ogbah. Could also see Thomas or Bell.
@drewpelto Here goes Lynch.
@drewpelto Man. That was quick for some scrub named Burns.
@drewpelto IF they don't. I've heard Sea and GB looking to trade back. Would you trade up for Jack or Lynch?
@drewpelto No kidding! They don't even need a LB and they'll do it anyway!
@drewpelto Watch Cincy go Jack here!
@drewpelto Coleman and Treadwell will be linked for quite a while. Time will tell.
@drewpelto Yup. Dammit. Well there's still Jack and Lynch and if they're gone Thomas.
"@drewpelto Robinson also there, but I'm not sure he fits a huge position of need."
"@drewpelto Haha! No not much. Just now with Doctson gone Jack, Treadwell, and Lynch still in play. Would have to get ahead of Den for Lynch."
If they are that worried about Trump then maybe they should have listened to US and elected the truly electable candidate!
Or they'll try their scare tactics that if you don't vote for HRC you'll get Trump. Bullshit! We've have the electoral power. Always did.
"Get ready Ind.'s. The Dems told U 2 ""fuck off, we don't need U"" w/ their closed primaries. Now they'll turn around &amp; beg you to join them."
@jricole @cenkuygur No
