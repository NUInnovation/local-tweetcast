@CandaceTX It's not.. that's why he is running for POTUS to bring about REAL change.. it's something Obama promised but later decided nah.
@CandaceTX @WoobieTuesday Didn't realize politicians paying lip service to an issue is supposed to be enough.
@JeanNamibian @ThePyat Those states are more important in the general just like the independent vote.
@TheYoungTurks Gun's starting bid: 5k. Raising money on the back of a murdered teen: Priceless.
@JeanNamibian @meghanflinders @ThePyat It's just one poll but H has a knack for losing massive leads to rivals. I am a little concerned.
@JeanNamibian @meghanflinders @ThePyat https://t.co/ptcvFaSYPv
@JeanNamibian Interesting H struggles in swing state vs Trump while Bernie crushes him. It's not like swings states are important in general
@JeanNamibian @meghanflinders @ThePyat Those are aggregate polls and not the most recent.
@CirceTejada @CultureInStereo @meghanflinders She is nearly tied in national polls w/ Trump and the FBI is on her tail. But facts be damned.
@CirceTejada @CultureInStereo @meghanflinders By talking about facts and numbers? mmmkay.
@seanr1978 Some might say.. even the toast is feeling the BERN.
"@laurelk229 More pledged dels, yes. But not enough to clinch nom. Polls are early but a good indication of what's to come. Trump is surging"
@Kacee50 @LetsGoBigDon @realDonaldTrump We have socialism for the very rich (top 1%) and rugged invidvidualism for the rest of us. -Dr. King
@TimBartender Speaking truth to power!  #FeelTheBern  https://t.co/j3eRnE5E43
@laurelk229 I am talking about SDs. Their whole purpose is to choose the strongest candidate for the general. Hillary is not it.
"@JeanNamibian @meghanflinders @ThePyat U need to update your numbers. Most recent poll has Clinton up by +1 in PA &amp; FL, She loses OH by -4"
@MichaelZarrabi @laurelk229 @meghanflinders  Biden knows something is coming soon. He is setting himself to replace H if shit hits fan
"I liked a @YouTube video from @thebpdshow https://t.co/NI9411Ufa2 Live! On the White Working Class, Biden &amp; Warren?, Alex Law, News &amp;"
@CirceTejada @CultureInStereo @meghanflinders Stick that head of yours deep in the sand and pretend all is well. https://t.co/Yj8oBfnymR
@CirceTejada @CultureInStereo @meghanflinders Recent polls suggest otherwise. She is in serious trouble.
@drvox @ggreenwald Translation: I'd rather block an actual journalist rather than take a close hard look in the mirror.
"Ran into yet another ""HillaryBro"". So classy. @ShaunKing @TheBpDShow https://t.co/00CjMsNSfY"
@CirceTejada @CultureInStereo @meghanflinders She won't survive Trump. Only Bernie can do that.
@CultureInStereo Except Hillary is now tied with Trump in the national polls... oops. Bernie beats Trump easily.
@CHURCHLADY320 @artist4ever Bernie has done nothing ... with the exception of this: https://t.co/oABDcpKtYL
I liked a @YouTube video https://t.co/LApBxSgObR The FBI Confims Investigation of Clinton's Emails NOT security review
@meghanflinders @ThePyat https://t.co/Yj8oBfnymR
@ddiCarlo Wrong again. Hillary voters will elect Trump by voting for a weak/flawed candidate like Hillary.
@ddiCarlo @CassandraRules Agreed!
@meghanflinders @ThePyat https://t.co/hI1o1nz1JN
"@meghanflinders @ThePyat Speaking of math, Hillary is tied to Trump in swing states. Do you still want to vote for someone who will lose?"
@meghanflinders @ThePyat Which opens the floor for contested convention where Bernie gets to make the case: He is a far stronger candidate.
"@meghanflinders @ThePyat Let's do math. Despite DNC rigging the primary for Hillary, she still can't reach 2383 pledged dels to clinch nom."
"@meghanflinders @ThePyat and using voter rigging, suppression and other shenanigans. but we are ignoring those...right?"
"@meghanflinders @ThePyat Why can't Hillary supporters learn contested convention rules? It's not about math, it's about elect-ability."
Happy 420! BERN down the Fox House (with facts). @NomikiKonst  https://t.co/YDwmnQnEZI
@samsteinhp Between Trump's taxes and Hillary's transcripts. Which will do more damage to their respective campaigns? My bet is on Hillary.
@CanProveIt I think he is fighting for what he believes in. But I can see your viewpoint if I too were to blindly follow party loyalty.
@AriBerman the Media knows as well as the rest of us that deporting 11 million people is unfeasible. Hillary's emails on the other hand...
@nana_mo_Amelika MSM is FINALLY starting to realize that her FBI invest. of her email server is actually kind of a BIG DEAL.
"@Delo_Taylor @KatieCVFowler Hillary uses a filter, Trump does not. But they say essentially the same thing."
@abowersock Hillary's worse nightmare came true: Only other person better than her @ flip-flopping is running vs her https://t.co/YoASn1TFU6
Hillary's worse nightmare is coming true: Only other person better than Hillary at flip-flopping is running vs her.  https://t.co/n15aAW1sVY
@yawchannel @SnowdenTheMovie Love the fact that @hitRECordJoe is playing @Snowden Love his acting.
"@AAPIforBernie @pja1776 @Nicky2133 @horseaunt If Hillary is struggling to win the nom vs an unknown senator, she will do worse vs Trump"
@TheYoungTurks Joe although an overall nice guy lives in the same establishment bubble and can't fathom Hillary losing despite recent polls.
@democracynow Looks like someone wants to raise some money on the back of innocent murdered kid. Classy.
"@artist4ever Bernie saves as many people as he can, prosecutes people responsible. Hillary tells them to cut it out and get paid millions."
@meghanflinders Hillary is already sinking. Imagine what would happen when Trump attacks Hillary non-stop on FBI invest &amp; Clinton Foundation
