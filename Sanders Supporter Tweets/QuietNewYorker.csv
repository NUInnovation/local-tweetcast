The magic that exists in NYC in areas like the Village today links in large part to Jane Jacobs' brilliant vision(s) https://t.co/CyJSdgeoQf

When #Obama won the #POTUS the media couldn't stop talking about how the country's gun sales went up as a result. Wrap your mind on that one
I remember the media barely talked about #Obama back in 2008 too. They talked about the #GOP &amp; #Clinton as if it were a marathon. $old out
You gotta love how the media raves about #HillaryClinton all night long if she has 4% of the vote in.but wait for #bernie to reach 50%üó£ $us
"This isn't new is it?Media rambling on about #Trump 24/7 like fanboys, barely talking about #berniesanders win in #Indiana . If HRC won?rave"
"Predicting that #bernie will win the next 3 states to finish off the month of May, making it clearer than ever that it'll boil down to Cali"
#WestVirginiaforBernie #KentuckyforBernie #OregonforBernie #MayforBernie
"The media world doesn't want to talk about Bernie's win in #Indiana , a fairly large state. They just talk about #Trump 24/7 #Bernie2016"
This is a üåéwhere the playing field in all competitions are rigged of equal respect from the start. People favor titan$ who win. Leicester ü§òüëè
This is a üåéwhere the playing field in all competitions are rigged of equal respect from the start. People favor titan$ who win.Go Bernie!üëè
Every year is a year for the underdog. Last year's title went to the #warriors . This year's underdogs are #LeicesterCity &amp; #BernieSanders
The reason #BernieSanders wins mostly all open primaries/caucuses is because all registered people are allowed to vote! #peopleforbernie
If #independent voters were allowed to vote in the states #bernie lost he would win. If #independent vote #BernieSanders will be #POTUS
"Love #BernieSanders spirit to keep on keeping on in this race! He is an underdog through and through.Underdogs never give up,neither can we!"
"I want to travel to all of the states that Bernie has or will win in the #Democratic race!!Been to some, not all.Super awesome people around"
"#BernieSanders all day baby!!!! üî•üî•üî•üî• ""We the people"" in #Indiana #Indiana rocks!!!! Let's keep this delegate momentum rolling! #Bernie2016"
Leicester City were an unknown team. They were seen as lower leaguers. Pundit$ said they had 5000/1 odds of winning. Claudio? Doubted.NowüèÜ
"Congrats to the boys of Leicester City! Congrats to Leicester, UK! 1st EPL title! Legends FOREVER! True teamwork $ can't buyüèÜ #lcfc #epl #UK"
At the end of the day the #election system in the #US limits people's power to truly make the country by and for the people. Rigged system.
The #DemocraticParty has treated #Bernie poorly and it's a shame.Bernie has been an independent for 20-30 yrs and now that he's a dem look..
Apparently Jill Stein was trying to attract #BernieSanders to the #GreenParty which I think is a party that'd truly love Bernie
The next few months for the #DemocraticParty will be interesting. #bernie has always been independent at heart so things can prove exciting
"#DonaldTrump knows that if #BernieSanders runs for President as an independent, Trump wouldn't have to worry about the #DemocraticParty"
#DonaldTrump suggested that #BernieSanders should run for President as an independent. Don't be fooled people Donald just wants to win
#HillaryClinton talking about how we should get money out of politics in her speech. Lady you are the fakest person out there! Ppl buy this?
I'm listening to the radio and the host said that it's no surprise that #Bernie won Rhode Island cus INDEPENDENTS WERE ALLOWED to VOTE! Yep.
If #BernieSanders didn't have to deal with the nonsense that is closed primaries he'd be winning right now. Independents are for #bernie2016
Thank you #RhodeIsland . At least your state still has brains. #FeelTheBern #BernieSanders #bernie2016 #votebernie
Tons of #HillaryClinton voters are voting for her just because she's a women....terrible
#HillaryClinton followers are sheep. Sad thing is most are so uninformed
So obvious that #HillaryClinton is faking it to make it. Her whole message is copied from what Sanders has been saying for 30 years! Joke
"I'm telling you right now a lot of people will not be voting for #HillaryClinton if she gets to the generalelection.""bold progressive goals"""
Still waiting for #HillaryClinton transcripts from her $200k speeches on Wall Street with the likes of Goldman Sachs...what's to hide?
Thought that #Connecticut where $ is prevalent would be a landslide #Clinton victory but #bernie is hanging on
@TheEconomist #bernie2016 #wethepeople https://t.co/yufkEoQp3a
Honestly does anyone even care about the #GOP race anymore?...It's inevitable that #donaldtrump will be the #gop nominee. Just disgusting
#HillaryClinton wakes up everyday to prevent the political revolution from happening. Real change is never moderate #bernie2016 #votebernie
This country man....no words #USA #politics #SuperTuesday
Man  0% are reporting from Maryland but apparently #hillaryclinton has already won. I swear they don't want #BernieSanders to win. Shameful
"The #dems are in trouble. Its progressives are ""not with her."" #Hillary is seen as a lady who wakes up every day to prevent real revolution"
The #DemocraticParty is split between progressives and moderate liberals (whatever that means). Idk about you but true change isn't moderate
"When a country realizes that it is a canal filled with blue blood after its people stand up and fight, real change happens! #votebernie"
These are the modern times in the developed world where people now get their joy from feeling as though they're superior to other people
The US govt &amp; society have become so capitalistic that its elite get joy from being superior to millions of people whom are enslaved to them
So apparently #connecticut allowed its state's residents the chance to register to vote all the way up until a few days ago. #NY take note
Very glad #BernieSanders has drawn light to how insanely corrupt the elections system is in the U$A. DJ Khaled: they don't want us to vote!
"Prediction:#Bernie will win Rhode Island, Delaware &amp; Maryland.He'll win rural PA but PA will be hard. CT will probably go to #HRC cus it's$$"
#people #berniesanders can not just win the counties and smaller states he has to win the big ones too! Bring all of your loved ones #vote
