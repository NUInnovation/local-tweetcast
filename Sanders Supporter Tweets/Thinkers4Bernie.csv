Remember how energized you were to vote for Bernie? That's how Berner's in the next 14 contests feel with 1016 delegates to give.
Campaign Reporters Fess Up: They Really Can't Stand Hillary Clinton https://t.co/1YqL1VTY5L #justsayin
"When people tell me I'm hurting HRC by pointing out her obvious flaws, I say -- why did you all prop up a horrible candidate?"
"What we need to spread is confidence, a path forward, a revolution! Block the bots, spread the light! &lt;/end pep talk&gt; &lt;3"
"@Thinkers4Bernie And for those of us paying attention, that is what they told us from DAY 1."
Here's what the media is telling us - we have a choice of Donald WTF Trump and Hillary Toss A Coin If She'll Be Indicted Clinton.
"It's psychological and a little bit physics folks. If they break you down, they win. Share the positive, ignore the spin!"
Don't let the media narrative get you down!  If we listened to them we would have fallen into line months ago! Indiana has 83 delegates.
"Unlike other states, HRC has NEVER had a strong lead in Indiana. Bernie's favorability ALWAYS soars when he is campaigning in a state."

@Thinkers4Bernie Makes me not trust them AT ALL.
@Thinkers4Bernie And the very fact that we have an option like Bernie Sanders and the Dem establishment isn't embracing it...
@Thinkers4Bernie That is the kind of leader that I can fall in line behind.
@Thinkers4Bernie The moral fiber of a person willing to make a stand like this for people who will likely never know he did it...

@BernieVolunteer @NomikiKonst The looks on those ladies faces when Nomiki brings up the dark $. Someone should show them HRC's own website:
@Brains4Bern She'll have to take some time and process.
"@Brains4Bern Oh, I'm sorry!  That really sucks."
@Brains4Bern It's not fun to deliver the news that you have nothing to do with.
@Brains4Bern That sucks.
"@bnyaosi @Bernslikehell @rosariodawson I'm so glad he's ""sorry"" though. That makes me feel better. :-\"
"It's surreal, you know -- to dislike a candidate so much that you legitimately hope for an indictment, and for that hope to be plausible."
@Fanny57 @NomikiKonst That's not actually true. Being Independent means they will look at all the candidates w/out partisan bias.
@MJMcElwee @Doc_Zschmidtke @BernieVolunteer @revantdeparis Ha!
"@kendalynx1234 @SouthernBerner @Vets4Bernie Yes, I'd say you've done your fair share. #UniteBlue #ImWithHer Step up!"

Dem Values: Universal Healthcare? Outrageous. With all the wars we have going on? Way too pie-in-the-sky to consider.
"Progressive values -- Private prisons, not a big concern. Seriously, nothing to see here."
Progressive recap: Apparently interventionism is a welcome world view for Dems.
So to recap: Progressive values mean Cayman Islands and Delaware tax loopholes are totally acceptable.

"@Ithinkitscatchy @PoliticalAnt Yes, I know that. I think Bernie was very skillful. Per polls last night, Dems only benefit from him running."
@Ithinkitscatchy @PoliticalAnt Anyone who wants to actually run in this country needs to run in one of the 2 parties. Huge problem.
