This dude is trying to sext me right now. How do I deal with these situations. Is it acceptable to say no thank you?
"I just want to listen to rise against, be a vegetarian and protest some shit"
I hate being a women for so many reasons. I'd like to hear a man argue why they have it worse
Told a coworker about how @zombabyx 's dad would sit outside her room while we were hanging out and make farting noises #GradeSchoolMemories
I hate when adults say our generation can't like something because it's not from our time. Like fucking watch me
It's cool to see the bitches from high school getting fat #bitter
"I hope you make a lot of friends out there, there are some bad ones, beware."

Roller derby is physically and emotionally challenging. That is all.
"If you're gonna be late to your hair appointment because you needed coffee, you could at least bring your stylist coffee too 🙃"
People with messy cars stress me out

Roller derby girls are hot as fuck..... 😏
I feel so bad for people that feel they need to be in a relationship. That they just can't be happy being single.
@zombabyx that's what made me think of them. I think that's hilarious.
3oh!3 was the bees knees. Wtf happened to them
You'd think living next to Portland that I'd have plenty
I need more weird friends

A salon is a bunch of girls trying to fuck each other over and I'm just not into that.
Sometimes I stress about shit... And I don't even know what it is. I just feel it
Fuckboys from WI saw my April fools joke about moving back home and are trying to hit me up #ItWasAJoke #FuckNO

How can anyone dislike her https://t.co/Fclq9ubfNU
First real roller derby practice tonight. #freshmeat
I wonder if people get annoyed of my snaps of my dogs... But I also don't give a shit
@daaremae that too 😜
I've never seen an ugly guy driving a Impreza
"If I could change one thing about me, it'd be the voices in my head. They don't like me."
I feel so good lately. Like I'm actually doing things for me and not to make anyone else happy. This is good.
I want a super punk haircut. Like a Mohawk or something
I don't like boys that have their read receipts off
It's so nice to just not give a fuck about anyone else but me. Fucking bliss.
Life is so good rn 🙏🏼
This guy in talking to just got a dog and my cousin said I could borrow hers to take to the dog park for a date. What a good wing man 😜
I'm getting stoned to forget about the fact that everyone ditched me to go to the bars tonight
I wish I could've gotten into pretty little liars. That show is just ridiculous
I really want a tattoo on the side of my head since it's already shaved
The world is coming down on me and I can't find a reason to be loved
I don't understand males
I don't get why people break check or slow down for tailgaters.... Just get the fuck out of their way #unpopularopinion
I need a guy that will drink coffee with me and read books... And just not talk.. #goals

Is running and being hungover a good idea? I really need to run but I don't want to die today
Being drunk before 11 is such an accomplishment. Now I can go to Bed at a reasonable time
@daaremae too many people doubted me hahahaha. I don't like being told I can't do something
I told my coworker I liked her skirt and she brought it in today and just gave it to me 😂
Numba 1 #holla ☕️ https://t.co/cvS1rtb4Wy

Why can't I be one of those people who genuinely love running. Why is it so difficult 💀
"@Jayy_K22 hahaha right, it does make me fee better about eating the pizza 😜like I wouldn't have eaten it either way!"
I just worked out and then ate pizza. What is even the point
I remember dreaming of the things I do right now 🌸
Politics are so exciting. Getting informed is exciting. Everyone in America should be excited. #merica
@zombabyx @MileyCyrus miles to go!! I was thinking about that the other day 😂
"@zombabyx ""put it on the pizza"" hahahaha like could I forget?"

If you're always a disappointment then it is harder to disappoint
I'll pay somebody $100 to write a 4 page essay for me

Team skateboard p ❤️
Hungry but skinny bitches don't eat soooooo
"It's your world, man. I'm just living in it."
Nobody cares about your friends day video on fb. Not gonna lie
I didn't drink any coffee today and I think I'm dying
I just can't seem to get it right today
I was gonna work out but forgot and showered so maybe tomorrow
Valentine's Day is the worst holiday. Like why. I mainly say this because I'm single. #foreveralone
What would 90s grunge think of grunge today?? Now that it's cool to be grunge. That defeats the purpose of grunge

"""She was unstoppable. Not because she did not have failures or doubts, but because she continued on despite them."""

"it's always funny when somebody does a ""Transformation Tuesday"" and they look the same"
i've been so obsessed with folk music lately and it's becoming a serious problem
The fact that I have to give up one dream for another really sucks

There's also a difference between doing your hair yourself and going to a salon
There's a difference from hair growth and shadow root
